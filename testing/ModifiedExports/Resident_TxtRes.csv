$AreaReport_CORLA_01_Detail,,"Though Costa del Sol is now a renowned beach resort, it was once home to a string of humble fishing villages. However, when relations between Shinra and the Republic of Junon began to deteriorate, Shinra annexed this portion of the coast. After the war, the company designated the area for redevelopment, transforming it into the must-visit location for avid sunseekers that it is today.<br><br>Costa del Sol offers vacation packages to suit any budget, allowing travelers from every corner of the globe to savor the idyllic beaches.

Though the work was hard and dangerous, the laborers banded together to overcome their difficulties, forming a close-knit community in the process.<br><br>Alas, the advent of mako saw the price of coal plummet, spelling disaster for the people of Corel. As they struggled to find a way forward, Shinra proposed the construction of a mako reactor, and after much debate, the villagers accepted the offer.<br><br>The reactor was constructed with astonishing haste, but just prior to being brought online, it was torn apart by an immense explosion, and has been left in ruins ever since."
$AreaReport_CORLA_02_Title,,Corel: A Tale of Decline
$AreaReport_CORLA_03_Detail,,"The tale of the Gold Saucer began with a Shinra employee named Dio, who convinced the company to build a museum called the Reliquary. Although it was doomed to failure, Dio was not to be deterred, and he set about founding the world's largest theme park, which he first conceived as a small-scale fairground.<br><br>In the wake of the Corel Mako Reactor explosion four years ago, plans were set in motion to revitalize the local economy. Hearing this, Dio decided to relocate his fairground to the region, eventually transforming it into a state-of-the-art entertainment complex.<br><br>Now known as the Gold Saucer, it is powered by several modular reactors, which are responsible for the surrounding area's accelerated desertification. In light of this, the reactors are now run at minimum output, in an attempt to mitigate further damage to the environment."

$AreaReport_CSMOA_01_Detail,,"Cosmo Canyon is located in the south of the western continent, where countless valleys and caverns have formed in the red clay. In ages past, seismic activity forced this soil to the surface, where it was later eroded by the surging lifestream below, giving the region its unique appearance.<br><br>Throughout the year, the canyon sees very little rainfall, and the temperature variation between the plateaus and gorges is considerable. As such, it is extremely difficult to grow crops, and the mere act of survival is a daily struggle. Nevertheless, the canyon is a prime destination for students of planetology. In addition to scholars and devotees, many tourists can also be found here, seeking to take in the ""mystical"" air. In more practical terms, the arid conditions and lack of cloud cover facilitate the observation of celestial bodies, making the canyon popular among astronomers."

$AreaReport_CSMOA_02_Detail,,"The founders of the canyon's eponymous village made use of the naturally formed caves, and following the emergence of planetology, more and more people found themselves drawn to the place. The makeshift walkways and tent-like domiciles have only increased in number as the settlement continues to expand to this day.<br><br>Rather than rely on mako, the villagers built an array of windmills, and each home is equipped to store the generated electricity. A leading planetologist, Bugenhagen, introduced this form of wind power to Cosmo Canyon, and it is said his technical marvel was inspired by the ways of the Cetra.<br><br>When it comes to nutrition, the villagers' diet consists mainly of grain and legumes grown around the village, supplemented by game meat obtained with traditional hunting methods."

$AreaReport_CSMOA_03_Detail,,"In the distant past, the Cetra made contact with the Gi, entities who could not return to the lifestream. Pitying their plight, the Cetra built altars to commune with and calm these tormented souls in the hope of finding a means to coexist peaceably.<br><br>Over time, the Cetra grew increasingly aware of the dire fate that would befall the planet, and resolved to entrust their knowledge to the people of Cosmo Canyon. These teachings would become the foundation of planetology, which continues to be refined through research and discourse even as it is spread throughout the world.<br><br>When the Cetra finally departed Cosmo Canyon, none remained to provide solace to the Gi, who in their festering anguish and rage were driven to turn on the villagers. Many brave warriors gave their lives to beat back these vengeful spirits, entombing them in their prison once more."

$AreaReport_GONGA_01_Detail,,"In ancient times, Gongaga was settled by descendants of the Cetra, who lived in quiet seclusion. The region was largely ignored by later kingdoms and empires, until the Republic of Junon thought to expand its influence westward. They soon discovered, though, that the expense of establishing trade routes through such dense jungle far outweighed the benefits of reaching the small communities there, and elected to instead construct an airstrip and little else.<br><br>When war erupted between the republic and Shinra, people the world over were impacted to varying degrees. Those in Gongaga were the rare exception, as being so far removed from the theater of war meant that they were not subject to forced conscription, nor were their villages ever host to the bloodshed."

$AreaReport_GONGA_02_Detail,,"The village of Gongaga lies at the heart of the humid jungle, where many species of moss, fern, and mushroom thrive. Its people have a long tradition of self-sustenance, growing only enough produce and raising only enough livestock to support their collective. Though the village is by no means commercially enterprising, the Gongaga mushroom endemic to the region is renowned for its rich aroma, and commands a high price.<br><br>Gongaga's fortunes took a turn for the worse following an explosion at the nearby mako reactor. Though much of the jungle was temporarily declared a disaster area, due to its elevated position, the village itself escaped the worst of the fallout─a small mercy considering the devastation wrought below."

This, however, did not deter Shinra from installing them at various locations throughout the world, including Gongaga.<br><br>The company's failure to follow their own inspection and maintenance procedures led to a disastrous explosion which claimed the lives of many villagers. Acknowledging its part in the incident, Shinra dedicated a monument to the victims.<br><br>This accident was not an isolated occurrence, though, as at least one other reactor is known to have exploded in a similar fashion. Stranger yet, Shinra has been investigating alleged sightings of gigantic life-forms known as ""Weapons"" near the remains of these destroyed mako reactors."

$AreaReport_GRASA_01_Detail,,"This humble town serves as a transport hub for the grasslands, hence the distinctive bailey built for the monitoring of commercial and private traffic. During the war with the Republic of Junon, Shinra saw fit to occupy Kalm, due to its stout fortifications and strategic value, and it has remained under company control ever since.<br><br>As it lacks a reactor of its own, Kalm is reliant on Midgar and its pipelines for a steady supply of mako, which is stored in a large tank for regulated use. This arrangement allows the residents to enjoy both modern conveniences and a healthy environment─a combination that has attracted many new residents of late.<br><br>Ten years ago, a significant portion of the town was ""damaged,"" though Shinra quickly intervened and carried out a comprehensive reconstruction effort. Details regarding the incident and the extent of the destruction are sparse."

Streams flowing from the central mountain range nourish the lush meadows below, which sustain a diverse range of species. Ranchers and farmers also benefit greatly from this bountiful environment.<br><br>Vast wetlands make up much of the southern region. In days past, boats and chocobo carriages were a common sight, but as most goods are now transported by sea or air, traffic through the wetlands has steadily decreased. Moreover, as an immense, man-eating serpent dubbed Midgardsormr has been sighted in this area of late, few dare to brave the old trails. Even those capable of evading the gargantuan snake may yet fall victim to one of the many inescapable quagmires."

The mineral boasts an exquisite shimmer and remarkable strength, and was historically used to fashion the very finest weapons and armor, but it fell out of favor after Shinra developed superior synthetic materials.<br><br>After the mine was closed, the Republic of Junon converted it into a tunnel for the general public, allowing travel to and from the grasslands. The glistening mythril deposits drew regular sightseers as well. Following Shinra's triumph over the republic, however, the tunnel has been effectively abandoned. Various sections have fallen into disrepair, and the depths are host to untold dangers."

$AreaReport_JUNOA_01_Detail,,"The people of Junon were once largely seafarers, who only returned to the shore to peddle the bounty of the ocean. Unlike other communities that settled in a single location and gradually expanded their territory, these sailors preferred the freedom of the open sea, and over time banded together with like-minded souls to form a unique society.<br><br>As a republic, they repurposed a flotilla of large vessels to construct a floating city that would serve as the center of their trade network. Having forged a robust infrastructure, they then set their sights on uniting the disparate peoples of the world.<br><br>Though Junon ushered in an era of economic and cultural prosperity, it was not to last.

Powered by the world's only underwater mako reactor and equipped with a colossal cannon capable of firing as far as Wutai, the stronghold resembles a vast battleship, risen from the deep to defend the eastern continent.<br><br>Junon is a city composed of multiple levels, each of which is lined with uniform buildings that were originally designed to serve the needs of military personnel. After the war with Wutai, some were converted into hotels and retail outlets, and the harbor and airport now see a constant stream of civilian visitors.<br><br>Military exercises are still conducted frequently, however, and should the need arise, defense countermeasures can be deployed at a moment's notice, transforming the city into a fortress, ready to repel would-be invaders."

Indeed, even plant life struggles to find a foothold here, and with tumbling boulders and rockslides a constant threat, the locals see little reason to make such a perilous journey.<br><br>Many of the mountain's caves are filled with mako vapor, and the inner reaches contain mako springs and naturally formed materia. Shinra's search for a new energy source led them to Mt. Nibel, and its abundant supply of mako made it the ideal site for the world's first reactor.<br><br>Although it played an instrumental role in the proliferation of mako energy, the Nibel reactor's time in the spotlight was brief, and it now operates at greatly reduced capacity."

However, their quiet existence would change dramatically with Shinra's discovery of vast reserves of mako within the mountain.<br><br>The company's efforts began with the construction of Shinra Manor on a plot of leased land. It was there that the head of Research and Development, Professor Gast, and his assistant, Professor Hojo, pioneered studies on mako and Jenova.<br><br>Shinra's financial investment delivered the people of Nibelheim from poverty. Their newfound happiness and prosperity would be short-lived, though, as the entire village was burned to the ground and countless innocents slaughtered by Sephiroth.<br><br>A perfect reconstruction of Nibelheim was later erected on the site in secret, and now serves as a treatment center for victims of mako poisoning."

$minigame_cardgame_presetdeck10_help,,"Revolves around cards with low power that raise your positions' ranks by 2.

$minigame_cardgame_presetdeck11_help,,"Includes cards that─when enfeebled─trigger game-changing abilities. Find the right moment to sacrifice them, and you can easily turn the tide of battle.

$minigame_cardgame_presetdeck2_help,,"Composed mainly of cards that enhance their allies, such as: Magic Pot, which can raise the power of up to four allies if placed correctly; and Chocobo & Moogle, whose power grows larger the more enhanced cards you have on the battlefield."
$minigame_cardgame_presetdeck2_name,,One for All
$minigame_cardgame_presetdeck4_help,,"Most of the cards in this deck have low power, but in turn gradually lower the power of your opponent's cards until they are destroyed. It also contains Midgardsormr, which grows in power the more cards are destroyed."
$minigame_cardgame_presetdeck4_name,,Blight Idea
$minigame_cardgame_presetdeck5_help,,"Composed of cards that either weaken or destroy other cards, regardless of affiliation. Once you've cleared the battlefield, use Mandragoras to add cards to your hand and secure positions for your army, all the while growing your Sea Devil's power."
$minigame_cardgame_presetdeck5_name,,Wreaking Havoc
$minigame_cardgame_presetdeck6_help,,"This deck contains many cards with powerful abilities that activate when destroyed.

This strategy works particularly well with the Tonberry King, whose power increases when allied cards are destroyed."

$minigame_cardgame_presetdeck7_help,,"Composed of cards that can only be played on top of allies, thus ""replacing"" them.

$minigame_cardgame_presetdeck8_help,,"Features various cards that, when enhanced, unleash powerful abilities.

$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0002,,Takes jockeys on a kupo-sedly kweh-ctacular jaunt through a forest where moogles once frolicked. <color=blue>The conveyor belts help or hinder depending on which way their arrows point.</color>
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0003,,Held on the grounds where many a cactuar trained their famously fast legs. <color=blue>Watch which way the saucers spin to keep your speed up!</color>
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0004,,"Like the bombs that detonated themselves and widened the track for this explosive event, <color=blue>bomb balloons will explode and slow you down if you get too close</color>!"
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0005,,"Possibly the most noxious race on the circuit. Be nice to your bird and put a mask on its beak! <color=blue>Also, avoid the cushions, unless you want to be bounced backwards.</color>"
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0006,,"Even a single ""doink"" on the final stretch can spell disaster, but one last spurt should keep you clear of knifepoint...<color=blue>unless you run into a closed cactuar gate</color>."
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0007,,"This cat-eat-cat race features power-hungry competitors, turns as sharp as claws, and <color=blue>spinning rods with metal orbs attached that should be avoided at all costs</color>."
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0008,,"A race famous for its bestial brawls. To make sure your bird isn't tossed around, make sure it's weighted down with the right gear! <color=blue>Also make sure to dodge the sliding boxes.</color>"
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0009,,"The ""ultima"" test for both jockey and bird, this race should only be run by those who have truly honed their racing skills. <color=blue>Use the jump panels to make your own shortcuts.</color>"
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0101,,The perfect showcase for those who are red-hot passionate about winning. <color=blue>Hop on the circular springboards to soar over any pesky obstacles!</color>
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0102,,"A race designed for strategists with ice in their veins and drifting on the brain. <color=blue>If you find the chilling water troublesome, use the ramps to jump over it.</color>"
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0103,,A race with lead changes as volatile as tempestuous ocean swells. <color=blue>Memorize the placement of each obstacle</color> to navigate these rough waters with ease.
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0104,,A race that rewards chocobos who are as quick as lightning. Zip past the competition by <color=blue>keeping an eye on the track's many hazards</color>!
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0105,,A race made possible by the rending of the earth. Split yourself from the rest of the field by <color=blue>taking note of what and where each obstacle is</color>.
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0106,,"Everyone will be pushed to their limits during this race. Its hairpin turns require impeccable drifting skills, while <color=blue>the numerous obstacles demand split-second decision-making</color>."
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0107,,"Held on the track where Sleipnir is said to have run. Make like the mythical horse and ride like the wind, all the while <color=blue>deftly navigating the myriad hazards that dot the course</color>."
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0108,,A race as challenging as it is imposing. Storm the gates and lay waste to the competition by <color=blue>evading each obstacle and leaving them in the dust</color>.
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0109,,"Run on a track that, like its namesake, veritably arose from the ashes. Survive this trial by fire─<color=blue>and overcome the many obstacles placed throughout</color>─to become a living legend."
$minigame_chocoborace_courseguide_0110,,Rising to the challenge in this race─held on the site of an ancient draconic power struggle─requires expertly-honed skills and <color=blue>an intricate knowledge of obstacle placement</color>.

$tutorial_Fld_02_0012,,Power and Positions
$tutorial_Fld_02_0012_00,,"Once a card is placed, its power is added to your lane total.

$tutorial_Fld_02_0013_00,,"Next, place a card so that one of its yellow tiles overlaps with one of your existing positions."
$tutorial_Fld_02_0014,,Position Ranks
$tutorial_Fld_02_0014_00,,"When one of your cards' position tiles overlaps with a position you control, the position rises in rank.

$tutorial_Fld_02_0017_00,,"You can keep track of who is winning a lane by looking at the point totals on each side of the board. The numbers on the left represent your power, while ones on the right represent your opponent's.<br><br>You may notice that some cards have tiles with red borders. These are the tiles that are affected by the card's ability. Place cards effectively to make the most of their abilities and amass more power in more lanes than your opponent.<br><br>In the event you cannot place a card, you can pass with <button=triangle>. When both players pass consecutively, the game will end."
$tutorial_Fld_02_0018,,Scoring
$tutorial_Fld_02_0018_00,,"Once the game is over, each player's score is tabulated. Only the player with the higher power in a lane has their power added to their score.<br><br>In other words, no matter how high your power in a lane may be, if it is less than your opponent's power in the same lane, it will not count toward your score.<br><br>After calculating the winner for each lane and adding their lane scores up, the player with the higher total score wins."
