$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_6310_00_mma,,Was getting here a day ahead of time overkill?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_6400_00_mma,,Maybe I got a little carried away with this whole proposal business... But the weekly horoscope was crystal clear!

$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6700_00_mfa,,Oh crap. I wasn't supposed to tell you that part.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6800_00_mma,,Took a wrong turn the other day and wound up at the lookout on the cliff.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6810_00_mma,,It was crawling with bandits. Do <i>not</i> recommend.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6900_00_mfa,,You gotta pay more attention to where you're going.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7000_00_mfa,,"I'll never forget the time you set off for the farms and somehow wound up at the swamp, surrounded by monsters."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7100_00_mma,,"Yeah, you think I would've learned by now that staring up at the sky as I walk is a recipe for disaster."

$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7810_00_mfa,,That materia pop eating contest was my chance to try the flavors I haven't yet.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7900_00_mfa,,"What about next week? They're bringing back that limited edition Titan pop. You liked that one, didn't you?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8000_00_mfa,,"Thing is, I gotta finish it, but that one's so big that by the time I have, I'll be way too full to try any of the other types."

$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8300_00_mfa,,"No worries, I'll lend you my copy. Oh, but don't spoil anything for other people, 'kay?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8400_00_mma,,My boy and I had a big falling-out.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8410_00_mma,,He moved to Midgar because of it. Word is he's a well-known singer now...
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8600_00_mfa,,I finally got my hands on the new issue of <i>Mysteryc</i>!

$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_9100_00_mfa,,One of these days I gotta make it out to Cosmo Canyon...
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10000_00_mma,,"Barely had time to squeeze in a nap, we were so busy."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10010_00_mma,,Though it paid well enough. One day's earnings were about what an average man makes in a month.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10100_00_mma,,"Well? Jealous? I'll bet you want my business card now, don't you?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10400_00_mma,,"So, what's new with you?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10410_00_mma,,"As for me, the hotel I left my son in Costa del Sol seems to be doing well."

$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10510_00_mma,,"Personally, I'm thinking of investing in a chocobo racing team."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10600_00_mma,,"If it's chocobos you're interested in, you'd be better off buying a ranch of your own. That's where the real money's at."

$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0500_00_mma,,I love the smell of fresh vegetables. There's nothing like it.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0600_00_mfa,,I'd better stock up on Ifrit oil while it's still on sale.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0700_00_mfa,,"Oh, that shop looks promising."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0800_00_mfa,,I always have a hard time deciding what I want.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0900_00_mfa,,"All these sales are so gosh darn tempting, but I gotta watch how much I spend."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_1000_00_mfa,,What hidden treasures will I find in the shops today?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_10100_00_mma,,You won't find any meat cheaper than mine! See for yourself!

$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4400_00_mma,,"So, how was your trip to Midgar? Did you hit up the Honeybee Inn like you always do?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4500_00_mma,,"Yeah, you should've been there, man. This blonde dude slayed the stage like I've never seen before."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4600_00_mma,,Then they beat his mug and sent him to Corneo's place.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4610_00_mma,,Hope he made it outta there in one piece.

$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5200_00_mma,,Hmm... But what made them the way they are?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5300_00_mma,,I'd bet all my gil that Shinra's got something to do with 'em.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5400_00_mma,,"Oh, I'm working on an article about those men in robes."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5500_00_mma,,"Most agree that they suffer from acute mako poisoning, but others theorize that they're also victims of secret experiments."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5600_00_mma,,"Personally, I think there's something even more sinister behind their existence, but I don't have any proof yet."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5700_00_mma,,And I'd better be careful making claims involving Shinra.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6000_00_mma,,I'll never forget those steamed buns. The minced meat filling was...it was heavenly.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6100_00_mma,,That's my one regret about leaving Midgar for good. No more stopping off for Sector 8 buns. I used to eat 'em every day.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6200_00_mma,,I'll miss that girl too. My little steamed honeybun...
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6210_00_mma,,I wonder if she's still selling them.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6300_00_mfa,,It's missing something... Maybe adding a few flowers from that big hill west of here will give it more variety?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6500_00_mfa,,"Red, blue, yellow... Could use green foxtails too."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6600_00_mfa,,"Yeah, that ought to really liven this up."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_7000_00_mfa,,Have you heard? Broden's missing. He just up and vanished!

$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7300_00_mma,,Shoulda heard the way they were moaning. Gave me the creeps.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7400_00_mfa,,Prob'ly some slum rats looking to get out of Midgar. Making a run for it with just the clothes on their backs.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7500_00_mma,,Like you guys did?

$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2800_00_mfa,,Get Shinra to send us more mako already!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3100_00_mma,,Took them long enough. Now life can finally go back to normal.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3200_00_mma,,That repairman's a lifesaver.

$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3600_00_mfa,,"They really should've gotten on it sooner, but at least it's fixed now."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3700_00_mfa,,Now to deal with all the laundry that's piled up.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3800_00_mfa,,"Well, I'm glad to see everything's back to how it should be."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_4100_00_mfa,,"So, let me get this straight. Rufus Shinra, the <i>new</i> president, is the son of the <i>old</i> one?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_4200_00_mfa,,"Yeah, but he's still so young. Dunno if he can handle all that responsibility."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_4300_00_mfa,,"Who cares? He's hot. Like, really hot."

$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_5210_00_mma,,"We may be an inspection team, but we can hold our own in a fight!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_5900_00_mma,,"Something good has to be in store for me after suffering through that interrogation. Patience is always rewarded, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6000_00_mfa,,"Oh look, dear. Seems they're practicing the dance for the harvest festival already."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6100_00_mfa,,"If I were a few years younger, I'd have to join them."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6200_00_mma,,"'Tis the season, huh?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6210_00_mma,,"Even if you can't keep up with them, you could still go and wiggle along with the beat."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6300_00_mfa,,When was the last time I danced?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6310_00_mfa,,Probably not since the day you and I met in Wall Market.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7200_00_mmk,,"Whop, whop, whop, whop, whop, whop, whop, whop! Whoosh! Airships are the coolest!"

$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7610_00_mfa,,Feels like they're watching my every move.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7700_00_mma,,The sight of those helmeted thugs is enough to make me tense no matter what I'm doing.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7800_00_mfa,,Then again─what if one of those helmets was hiding the man of your dreams?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7900_00_mma,,"Well, under different circumstances, I might not mind getting to know one."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0700_00_mfa,,I can't even remember the last time you invited me out for lunch like this.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0800_00_mfa,,"So, how much do you need this time? Would another three hundred gil cover it?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0900_00_mma,,"Um, five hundred would be ideal..."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0910_00_mma,,But that's all! And then I can get Fuzzy Wuzzy.
