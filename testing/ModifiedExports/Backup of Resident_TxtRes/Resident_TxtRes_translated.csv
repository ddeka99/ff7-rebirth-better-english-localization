$C2010_MAIN_3850_0100_00_chd,"I have assessed the data and created tasks for you, Cloud."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_0200_00_chd,I've named it the 'World Report'!
$C2010_MAIN_3850_0300_00_chd,"I would like you to undertake various tasks while you travel the world, Cloud."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_0400_00_chd,The data you gather will help develop new materia.
$C2010_MAIN_3850_0500_00_chd,"In essence, it will be a joint research project between you and me, Cloud."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_0600_00_chd,Do you have any questions about the World Report?
$C2010_MAIN_3850_1300_00_chd,The communications towers were built by the Republic of Junon to observe the planet's activity.
$C2010_MAIN_3850_1400_00_chd,They collect various energy reactions...
$C2010_MAIN_3850_1410_00_chd,"providing information about rare monsters, unknown regions, and ancient relics..."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_1420_00_chd,and potentially offering various useful information for your adventures.
$C2010_MAIN_3850_1500_00_chd,"If you come across one, please do activate it."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_1600_00_chd,"Please be careful, as monsters often inhabit the areas around the communication towers."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_1800_00_chd,"With the use of VR goggles, you can engage in simulated battles anywhere."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_1900_00_chd,That's the 'Battle Simulator'!
$C2010_MAIN_3850_2000_00_chd,I've borrowed Shinra's training technology and customized it to my own specifications.
$C2010_MAIN_3850_2100_00_chd,"Using the battle data collected from various assignments,"
$C2010_MAIN_3850_2200_00_chd,"I'll be updating the simulator regularly, so look forward to it!"
$C2010_MAIN_3850_2300_00_chd,"Additionally, I plan to recreate various summons in the virtual space by analyzing myths and legends."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_2400_00_chd,I've already analyzed the data of the legendary giant
$C2010_MAIN_3850_2410_00_chd,and implemented the Titan summon into the simulator after researching the legends of the Grasslands.
$C2010_MAIN_3850_2500_00_chd,Feel free to give it a try.
$C2010_MAIN_3850_2600_00_chd,"With these VR goggles, you can engage in simulations anytime, anywhere."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_2700_00_chd,This is the battle simulator.
$C2010_MAIN_3850_2800_00_chd,"It can recreate fights with summons,"
$C2010_MAIN_3850_2810_00_chd,and it updates using battle data collected from your missions.
$C2010_MAIN_3850_2900_00_chd,"Please, give it a try."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_3000_00_chd,The data collected from your missions can be used for materia development.
$C2010_MAIN_3850_3100_00_chd,"Which materia to develop is up to you, Cloud."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_3110_00_chd,Let's create new materia together.
$C2010_MAIN_3850_3200_00_chd,"Then, let's begin developing new materia immediately."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_3300_00_chd,Activating the communication tower has allowed me to make some progress in analyzing the grasslands.
$C2010_MAIN_3850_3400_00_chd,The data obtained can be used for developing materia.
$C2010_MAIN_3850_3410_00_chd,"Mr. Cloud, please decide which one you prefer."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_3500_00_chd,"Well then, this marks the beginning of your adventure around the world."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_3600_00_chd,"I will do my utmost to support you. If you ever need help, just reach out to me anytime."
$C2010_MAIN_3850_3700_00_chd,Do you have any other questions about the World Report?
$C2010_MAIN_3860_0100_00_chd,Which task would you like to inquire about?
$C2010_MAIN_3860_0101_00_chd,Which specific task would you like to inquire about?
$C2010_MAIN_3860_0800_00_chd,There are monsters in the world that have adapted to harsh environments and evolved uniquely.
$C2010_MAIN_3860_0900_00_chd,"Please locate and defeat these unique creatures inhabiting various regions, and gather data on them."
$C2010_MAIN_3860_1000_00_chd,"In remote areas, fragments of planetary wisdom have crystallized."
$C2010_MAIN_3860_1100_00_chd,Among the vast knowledge encapsulated within these crystals...
$C2010_MAIN_3860_1200_00_chd,...is information about the summons passed down in that region.
$C2010_MAIN_3860_1300_00_chd,By analyzing these crystals and extracting the data...
$C2010_MAIN_3860_1310_00_chd,...I should be able to enhance summoning materia.
$C2010_MAIN_3860_1400_00_chd,"Thank you for listening, Cloud!"
$C2010_MAIN_3860_1410_00_chd,I actually observed some kind of unknown energy reaction.
$C2010_MAIN_3860_1500_00_chd,It seems to be emitted by what I speculate to be relics from the past.
$C2010_MAIN_3860_1600_00_chd,We can't identify it at the moment and there's no telling what could happen if we get close.
$C2010_MAIN_3860_1700_00_chd,"Since there wasn't a name for this substance, I decided to call it 'Ancient Matter.'"
$C2010_MAIN_3860_1800_00_chd,I'm thrilled to have the chance to name it myself.
$C2010_MAIN_3860_1900_00_chd,"Cloud, please help us investigate and recover these mysterious relics, the Ancient Matter."
$C2010_MAIN_3860_2000_00_chd,It's an unidentified substance that seems to emit unknown energy and is presumed to be relics of the past.
$C2010_MAIN_3860_2100_00_chd,I’ve named it ‘Ancient Matter!’ There's no telling what may happen if you get close.
$C2010_MAIN_3860_2200_00_chd,"Please keep this mysterious relic, the Ancient Matter, in mind and help us with its investigation and recovery."
$C2010_MAIN_3860_2300_00_chd,There are several spots in this world where the Lifestream springs to the surface.
$C2010_MAIN_3860_2400_00_chd,"To Shinra, the mako energy from these springs is negligible—too insignificant to bother with."
$C2010_MAIN_3860_2500_00_chd,"But to us, they are a precious gift from the planet."
$C2010_MAIN_3860_2600_00_chd,We should be able to gain new insights by investigating these life spots.
$C2010_MAIN_3860_2700_00_chd,Do you have any other questions about the quests?
$C2010_MAIN_3870_0100_00_chd,Do you have any questions about the world report?
$C2010_MAIN_3870_0200_00_chd,Is there anything you're having trouble with?
$C3010_MAIN_3400_0100_00_cid,Thanks for choosing us!
$C3010_MAIN_3400_0200_00_cid,You called?
$C3010_MAIN_3400_0300_00_cid,Is it my turn?
$C3010_MAIN_3400_0400_00_cid,Hold on tight!
$C3010_MAIN_3400_0500_00_cid,Don't be scared!
$C3010_MAIN_3400_0600_00_cid,Try not to fall for my skills!
$C3010_MAIN_3500_0100_00_cid,Thanks for your business!
$C3010_MAIN_3500_0200_00_cid,"Keep coming back, alright?"
$C3010_MAIN_3500_0300_00_cid,See you around!
$C3210_MAIN_1700_0100_00_cid,This is your captain speaking. We're heading out to open waters.
$C3210_MAIN_1700_0200_00_cid,"Be on the lookout for sudden ocean waves, alright?"
$C3210_MAIN_1700_0300_00_yfi,Give me a break...
$C3210_MAIN_1700_0400_00_red,Achoo...
$C3210_MAIN_1700_0500_00_cid,This is a small boat. Don't think we can handle a long voyage.
$C3210_MAIN_1700_0600_00_cid,So keep that in mind!
$C3210_MAIN_1710_0100_00_cid,We can't see ahead. Let's turn back.
$C3210_MAIN_1710_0200_00_cid,There’s fog. Should we head back?
$C3210_MAIN_1710_0300_00_cid,Fog ahead! Hard to starboard!
$C3210_MAIN_1720_0100_00_cid,Let's avoid Shinra's ports.
$C3210_MAIN_1720_0200_00_cid,Junon port is too risky.
$C3210_MAIN_1720_0300_00_cid,We better get going before Shinra spots us!
$C3210_MAIN_1730_0100_00_cid,"Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm...♪"
$C3210_MAIN_1730_0200_00_cid,"Think it's about time we kicked it up a notch. Full speed ahead, full steam!"
$C3210_MAIN_1730_0300_00_cid,"Clear skies, no wind, no waves. Absolutely nothing!"
$C3210_MAIN_1730_0310_00_cid,"Damn it, at this rate I'll fall asleep."
$C3210_MAIN_1730_0400_00_cid,Could really use a storm to wake things up...
$C3210_MAIN_1730_0500_00_cid,"Attention passengers, this is your captain speaking. If you're feeling seasick, try looking up at the sky."
$C3210_MAIN_1730_0600_00_cid,"Blue sky, clouds floating gently, and the sun beaming down. And slicing through it all, the Tiny Bronco."
$C3210_MAIN_1730_0700_00_cid,"Looping, diving, spiraling, and pulling up just in time!"
$C3210_MAIN_1730_0710_00_cid,"Aw hell, now I really feel like flying!"
$C3210_MAIN_1730_0800_00_cid,"Sailing's nice and all, but nothing beats the sky, right?"
$C3210_MAIN_1730_0900_00_cid,"If I'd known it would come to this, I would've done a better job on maintenance."
$C3210_MAIN_1730_1000_00_cid,"Alright, bring it on! Big waves, small waves, anything at all! I'm not scared of some puny waves!"
$C3210_MAIN_1730_1100_00_cid,"Alright, bring it! Give me everything you've got!"
$C3310_MAIN_0100_0100_00_cid,"Oh, you’re here!"
$C3310_MAIN_0100_0200_00_vin,We’ll use the radio.
$C3310_MAIN_0100_0300_00_cid,"It's old, can it still work?"
$C3310_MAIN_0100_0400_00_vin,That’s convenient.
$C3310_MAIN_0500_0100_00_cid,I've still got some maintenance to do. Just give me a shout when you're ready to go.
$C3310_MAIN_0600_0100_00_cid,"Oh, heading out?"
$CARDG_QST_01_0100_0100_00_cmr,Who's the strongest one here?
$CARDG_QST_01_0100_0200_00_cmr,I'll show you the essence of Queen's Blood!
$CARDG_QST_01_0100_0300_00_cmr,Hmph. Is no one bold enough to challenge me?
$CARDG_QST_01_0200_0100_00_cmr,I want to fight someone strong.<br>Come back after you've risen in rank.
$CARDG_QST_01_0200_0200_00_cmr,"With your current rank, I can't show you my true potential."
$CARDG_QST_01_0200_0300_00_cmr,"Hmph, finally someone with potential has shown up."
$CARDG_QST_01_0200_0400_00_cmr,I'm Cameron the Wanderer.<br>A brawler who travels the world seeking strong opponents.
$CARDG_QST_01_0200_0500_00_cmr,"I've crossed mountains, forded rivers, and wandered through plains."
$CARDG_QST_01_0200_0600_00_cmr,"As I communed with the wilds,<br>I discovered the true essence of Queen's Blood."
$CARDG_QST_01_0200_0610_00_cmr,I'll show it to you now.
$CARDG_QST_01_0200_0700_00_cmr,Are you ready?
$CARDG_QST_01_0200_0800_00_cmr,What's wrong? Are you scared?
$CARDG_QST_01_0200_0900_00_cmr,I'll teach you the true spirit of Queen's Blood.
$CARDG_QST_01_0200_1000_00_cmr,Show me your true essence.
$CARDG_QST_01_0200_1100_00_cmr,"Indeed, the Queen's Blood is profound. It was an excellent training session, thank you."
$CARDG_QST_01_0300_0100_00_rdl,What’s going on? What's happening?
$CARDG_QST_01_0300_0110_00_rdl,I just wanted to create something everyone could play together...
$CARDG_QST_01_0300_0200_00_rdl,What?
$CARDG_QST_01_0300_0300_00_rdl,Again? That voice...
$CARDG_QST_01_0300_0310_00_rdl,Is it really... happening?
$CARDG_QST_01_0300_0400_00_rdl,"No, it can’t be. It was just supposed to be a card game."
$CARDG_QST_01_0300_0600_00_rdl,????
$CARDG_QST_01_0300_0610_00_rdl,No way... Why is this happening?
$CARDG_QST_01_0300_0700_00_rdl,At this rate... I need to tell them about Queen's Blood immediately...
$CARDG_QST_01_0400_0100_00_cmr,What's wrong?
$CARDG_QST_01_0400_0110_00_cmr,Did you get so absorbed in the card bout that you started seeing things?
$CARDG_QST_01_0400_0200_00_cmr,You look like you've seen a ghost.
$CARDG_QST_01_0400_0300_00_cmr,"Now that I think about it, Lidrehl, the historian who created Queen's Blood..."
$CARDG_QST_01_0400_0400_00_cmr,"Right after releasing the cards, he said he started hearing 'strange voices.'"
$CARDG_QST_01_0400_0500_00_cmr,"After that, he disappeared from public view and died alone at home."
$CARDG_QST_01_0400_0600_00_cmr,There are quite a few people whose lives have been derailed by this game. It's just that captivating and deep.
$CARDG_QST_01_0400_0700_00_cmr,Battling you allowed me to discover a new essence of the game.
$CARDG_QST_01_0400_0800_00_cmr,It was good training. I appreciate it.
$CARDG_QST_01_0500_0100_00_cmr,"Heh heh heh, this is what Queen's Blood is truly about."
$CARDG_QST_01_0500_0200_00_cmr,Don't worry about it. I'm just too strong.
$CARDG_QST_01_0500_0300_00_cmr,"To end in a draw with me, you must have trained quite a lot."
$CARDG_QST_01_0500_0400_00_cmr,I need to wander more to find the true essence.
$CARDG_QST_01_0500_0500_00_cmr,"Ugh, it looks like I still need more training."
$CARDG_QST_02_0100_0200_00_nvr,"Begone, evil spirits!"
$CARDG_QST_02_0100_0300_00_nvr,Mmmmm... Hah!
$CARDG_QST_02_0200_0100_00_nvr,You still lack the training to fight me.
$CARDG_QST_02_0200_0200_00_nvr,I'm meditating. Do not disturb me.
$CARDG_QST_02_0200_0300_00_nvr,"Oh, you’ve finally arrived. I've been waiting for you."
$CARDG_QST_02_0200_0400_00_nvr,"Hohoho, no need to be so cautious."
$CARDG_QST_02_0200_0500_00_nvr,You stand out too much in this small village. I could sense you wherever you were.
$CARDG_QST_02_0200_0600_00_nvr,"I am Navalan of the Hundred Eyes, attained through meditation."
$CARDG_QST_02_0200_0700_00_nvr,It's useless to hide; I see through everything about you.
$CARDG_QST_02_0200_0800_00_nvr,"Such a complex and powerful aura... Yes, you are a worthy opponent!"
$CARDG_QST_02_0200_0900_00_nvr,"Come, face me with all your might."
$CARDG_QST_02_0200_1000_00_nvr,"Hohoho, are you afraid of being exposed to the core?"
$CARDG_QST_02_0200_1100_00_nvr,"Let's see, I will lay you bare with my mind's eye."
$CARDG_QST_02_0200_1200_00_nvr,How about I take a peek into your heart?
$CARDG_QST_02_0200_1300_00_nvr,There is an evil aura lingering around the Queen's Blood. You should be careful.
$CARDG_QST_02_0300_0100_00_rdl,My name is Lidrehl Balmon. I am the creator of Queen's Blood.
$CARDG_QST_02_0300_0200_00_rdl,"In other words, all of this is my responsibility."
$CARDG_QST_02_0300_0210_00_rdl,I never imagined it would come to this.
$CARDG_QST_02_0300_0300_00_rdl,Did you hear that? We're running out of time.
$CARDG_QST_02_0300_0310_00_rdl,She's calling. We have to move.
$CARDG_QST_02_0300_0400_00_rdl,I am trapped.
$CARDG_QST_02_0300_0410_00_rdl,Bound by her cursed card. The end is near.
$CARDG_QST_02_0300_0500_00_rdl,No...is this the beginning?
$CARDG_QST_02_0300_0600_00_rdl,The Shadowblood Queen is--
$CARDG_QST_02_0400_0100_00_nvr,"Have you, by chance, seen the hallucinations of Lidrehl?"
$CARDG_QST_02_0400_0200_00_cld,Do you know something about it?
$CARDG_QST_02_0400_0300_00_nvr,"Lately, there have been rumors among Ba'utahs about seeing strange daydreams."
$CARDG_QST_02_0400_0400_00_nvr,"They say the ghost of Lidrehl, who created Queen's Blood, speaks to them."
$CARDG_QST_02_0400_0500_00_nvr,But that's not all.
$CARDG_QST_02_0400_0510_00_nvr,"Recently, renowned Ba'utahs have been dying mysterious deaths one after another."
$CARDG_QST_02_0400_0600_00_nvr,Some say it's the curse of Lidrehl.
$CARDG_QST_02_0400_0700_00_nvr,Even my spiritual eye cannot discern it. Something evil is stirring.
$CARDG_QST_02_0400_0800_00_nvr,"If you aim to become the strongest Ba'utah, be very careful."
$CARDG_QST_02_0500_0100_00_nvr,Don't be deceived by what you see. Use your inner eye.
$CARDG_QST_02_0500_0200_00_nvr,You need to further train your mind's eye.
$CARDG_QST_02_0500_0300_00_nvr,"To draw with me, that's quite impressive."
$CARDG_QST_02_0500_0400_00_nvr,"You've improved again, haven't you?"
$CARDG_QST_02_0500_0500_00_nvr,It seems I've been stripped bare.
$CARDG_QST_03_0100_0100_00_wis,Algorithm construction complete.
$CARDG_QST_03_0100_0200_00_wis,Assessing energy output...
$CARDG_QST_03_0100_0300_00_wis,Severe damage to cooling fans from sand. Maintenance requested.
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_0100_00_wis,Wize has undergone a version upgrade. Your current level is no match for me.
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_0200_00_wis,Please come back after increasing your rank.
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_0300_00_wis,Your bout power is insufficient. Please come back after increasing your rank.
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_0400_00_wis,"Long time no see, Mr. Cloud."
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_0500_00_wis,"Since our bout aboard the ship, Wize has successfully completed a version upgrade."
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_0600_00_wis,Allow me to introduce: 'Wize Type III Ver.2.0'!
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_0700_00_wis,Hmm... You possess considerable bout power.
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_0800_00_wis,I am 'Wize Type III Ver.2.0'.
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_0810_00_wis,The ultimate card bout robot!
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_0900_00_wis,I was just thinking it was time to test my capabilities after the upgrade.
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_1000_00_wis,"With your skills, there should be no problem."
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_1010_00_wis,"Well then, let's have a fair match!"
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_1100_00_wis,That's unfortunate. Maybe next time.
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_1200_00_wis,Would you like to engage in a card bout?
$CARDG_QST_03_0200_1300_00_wis,Please allow me to measure your bout skills.
$CARDG_QST_03_0300_0300_00_rdl,I shouldn't have gotten involved.
$CARDG_QST_03_0300_0400_00_rdl,It wasn't just a legend. It was a disaster—
$CARDG_QST_03_0300_0410_00_rdl,I can't stop trembling.
$CARDG_QST_03_0300_0500_00_rdl,I have to get rid of this card.
$CARDG_QST_03_0300_0510_00_rdl,"I know, but I just can't..."
$CARDG_QST_03_0300_0700_00_rdl,It's all too late.
$CARDG_QST_03_0500_0100_00_wis,Looks like I've won. This is the power of an upgrade.
$CARDG_QST_03_0500_0200_00_wis,"Heh heh heh. Cloud, would you consider upgrading yourself too?"
$CARDG_QST_03_0500_0300_00_wis,"A draw, huh? Not bad."
$CARDG_QST_03_0500_0400_00_wis,"Hrm, I guess I'll need more upgrades."
$CARDG_QST_03_0500_0500_00_wis,"Impressive. What version are you on, Cloud?"
$CARDG_QST_04_0100_0100_00_leg,What is this voice?
$CARDG_QST_04_0100_0200_00_leg,The queen...?
$CARDG_QST_04_0100_0300_00_leg,What’s going on here?
$CARDG_QST_04_0200_0100_00_leg,You're not at a high enough rank to face me right now.
$CARDG_QST_04_0200_0200_00_leg,"If you want to challenge me, you'll need to climb the ranks."
$CARDG_QST_04_0200_0300_00_leg,"You look familiar... Oh, right, you're Cloud, aren't you?"
$CARDG_QST_04_0200_0301_00_leg,Do you need something?
$CARDG_QST_04_0200_0400_00_leg,"Cloud, huh? What brings you here?"
$CARDG_QST_04_0200_0500_00_leg,"Are you looking for a match, by any chance?"
$CARDG_QST_04_0200_0510_00_leg,I guess I don't mind.
$CARDG_QST_04_0200_0600_00_leg,"Alright, let's get this over with."
$CARDG_QST_04_0200_0700_00_leg,"Very well, if that's what you want."
$CARDG_QST_04_0200_0800_00_leg,"Wait, are you challenging me or what?"
$CARDG_QST_04_0200_0900_00_leg,"If it's a fight you want, let's get it over with quickly."
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_0100_00_rdl,Allow me to tell you an old tale.
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_0200_00_rdl,"Once, there was a queen of incomparable beauty and kindness."
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_0210_00_rdl,"The queen was beloved by her people, and she loved them in return."
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_0300_00_rdl,"However, one day, the queen suddenly transformed into a cruel and ruthless ruler."
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_0400_00_rdl,"It was as though only her appearance and voice remained the same, while her inner self had changed completely."
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_0500_00_rdl,"From that point on, the queen used the lives of her people to begin conquests."
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_0510_00_rdl,"As her territory expanded, her people continued to perish."
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_0600_00_rdl,"One day, a witch appeared before the suffering people."
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_0700_00_rdl,"This witch, wielding mysterious powers of emerald hue, led the people to capture and execute the queen."
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_0800_00_rdl,"From the queen’s spilled dark crimson blood, monsters were born and spread throughout the world."
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_0900_00_rdl,And this is the story of the Crimson Black Queen.
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_1000_00_rdl,"Just an old story, a legend, a folktale...or so it was supposed to be."
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_1100_00_rdl,But she was real.
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_1110_00_rdl,"No, to be precise, she is about to be born."
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_1200_00_rdl,"You understand now, don't you?"
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_1210_00_rdl,The Crimson Black Queen. We must not let her be resurrected.
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_1300_00_rdl,"I couldn't do it. Now, it's up to you."
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_1310_00_rdl,"Yes...you, Cloud."
$CARDG_QST_04_0300_1400_00_rdl,I'll be waiting at the Haunted Hotel. Hurry.
$CARDG_QST_04_0400_0110_00_leg,"Sorry, I'm not feeling well."
$CARDG_QST_04_0400_0200_00_leg,"Hey, Cloud. Do you know about the 'Crimson-Black Queen' card?"
$CARDG_QST_04_0400_0300_00_leg,"It's the strongest rare card in the world, and there's only one of it. Actually, there's a card that pairs with it."
$CARDG_QST_04_0400_0400_00_leg,It's called the 'Emerald Witch'.
$CARDG_QST_04_0400_0500_00_leg,"Sorry, forget what I just said."
$CARDG_QST_04_0400_0600_00_leg,I think I'm tired. I'm going to take a little rest.
$CARDG_QST_04_0500_0100_00_leg,"There, satisfied now?"
$CARDG_QST_04_0500_0200_00_leg,"That's enough, don't you think? I have some things to think about."
$CARDG_QST_04_0500_0300_00_leg,"I'm not feeling well. Please, let me rest."
$CARDG_QST_05_0100_0100_00_rdl,Not here yet...
$CARDG_QST_05_0100_0200_00_rdl,At this rate...
$CARDG_QST_05_0100_0300_00_rdl,We have to hurry.
$CARDG_QST_05_0200_0200_00_rdl,You're not strong enough yet. Go and train some more.
$CARDG_QST_05_0200_0300_00_rdl,"Welcome, Cloud."
$CARDG_QST_05_0200_0400_00_rdl,"I am Lidrehl Balmon, creator of Queen's Blood."
$CARDG_QST_05_0200_0500_00_rdl,"I'm speaking to you secretly, but I don't have much time."
$CARDG_QST_05_0200_0600_00_rdl,Show me your power before the queen finds out.
$CARDG_QST_05_0200_0700_00_rdl,Hurry up.
$CARDG_QST_05_0200_0800_00_sct,I'll be waiting for your next challenge.
$CARDG_QST_05_0200_0900_00_rdl,"Cloud, show me your strength."
$CARDG_QST_05_0200_1000_00_sct,Welcome to the Haunted Hotel. Care for a game with the dead?
$CARDG_QST_05_0400_0100_00_rdl,"If you can't beat me, there's no way you'll stand a chance against the queen."
$CARDG_QST_05_0400_0200_00_sct,"Hahaha... Losing to a ghost? Shame on you, a living person."
$CARDG_QST_05_0400_0300_00_sct,Did you enjoy your bout with a ghost?
$CARDG_QST_05_0400_0400_00_sct,What a splendid fight! I nearly felt like ascending to the heavens myself.
$CARDG_QST_06_0100_0100_00_vin,Need something?
$CARDG_QST_06_0100_0200_00_vin,I see. Looks like you've been led by ghosts too.
$CARDG_QST_06_0100_0300_00_vin,Queen's Blood... You've dug up quite a troublesome story.
$CARDG_QST_06_0100_0400_00_cld,Do you have the witch's card?
$CARDG_QST_06_0100_0500_00_vin,The Emerald Witch?
$CARDG_QST_06_0100_0510_00_vin,"Indeed, by some twist of fate, it is in my hands."
$CARDG_QST_06_0100_0600_00_vin,Let's see if you are worthy of holding the witch.
$CARDG_QST_06_0100_0700_00_vin,No need to be ashamed. Retreating from the enemy can be a viable strategy.
$CARDG_QST_06_0100_0900_00_vin,Let's see if you are worthy of holding the witch.
$CARDG_QST_06_0100_1000_00_vin,I'll take you on.
$CARDG_QST_06_0200_0100_00_vin,It seems fate involving the queen and the witch has chosen you.
$CARDG_QST_06_0200_0110_00_vin,The darkness spread by this frenzied game runs deeper than we imagined.
$CARDG_QST_06_0200_0200_00_vin,Underestimating it will pull you in. Be careful.
$CARDG_QST_06_0200_0300_00_vin,The situation is more serious than I thought.
$CARDG_QST_06_0200_0400_00_vin,The witch's card will guide you to the queen.
$CARDG_QST_06_0200_0500_00_vin,"I'll leave the rest to you, Cloud."
$CARDG_QST_06_0300_0100_00_vin,"If you can't beat me, I'm not handing over the witch."
$CARDG_QST_06_0300_0200_00_vin,That was a decent way to pass the time.
$CARDG_QST_06_0300_0300_00_vin,Looks like I was expecting too much.
$CARDG_QST_06_0300_0400_00_vin,You're flawless. Nicely done on refining your skills.
$CARDG_QST_06_0300_0500_00_vin,That's a good deck you have. You've clearly put in a lot of effort.
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_0100_00_leg,"Oh, Cloud. So you came."
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_0200_00_leg,"Hey, could you give us some privacy?"
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_0300_00_leg,This card is where it all began.
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_0400_00_leg,I just wanted to be strong.
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_0500_00_leg,"If Queen's Blood was powerful, people wouldn't look down on me, wouldn't mock me."
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_0600_00_leg,"But the stronger I became, the more afraid I grew."
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_0700_00_leg,That someday I wouldn't be able to win anymore and no one would pay attention to me.
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_0800_00_leg,That I'd lose everything.
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_0900_00_leg,"So when I accidentally got this card, I thought it was a gift from the gods."
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_1000_00_leg,But... it wasn't like that at all.
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_1100_00_leg,I can hear the voice of the card.
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_1110_00_leg,"It says, 'Surrender yourself to its power, rule over everything.'"
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_1200_00_leg,"I've tried so hard to resist, but it seems I can't hold on any longer."
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_1300_00_cld,Regina?
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_1400_00_leg,How nostalgic.
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_1410_00_leg,This land was once under my dominion.
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_1500_00_leg,Until that wretched witch and those foolish townsfolk put an end to me.
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_1600_00_leg,"Prepare yourself, puppet."
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_1700_00_leg,I am the Shadowblood Queen.
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_1710_00_leg,"You have a blood debt to repay, and you will do so with blood."
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_1800_00_leg,"What's wrong, getting cold feet?"
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_1900_00_leg,The cost of blood is high.
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_2000_00_leg,"Are you ready, oh puppet?"
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_2100_00_leg,The cost of blood is high.
$CARDG_QST_07_0100_2200_00_leg,"Are you ready, oh puppet?"
$CARDG_QST_07_0200_0100_00_leg,How boring.
$CARDG_QST_07_0200_0110_00_leg,I shall grant you one more chance.<br>Give it your all and entertain me.
$CARDG_QST_07_0200_0200_00_leg,I'll play with you until I get used to this body.<br>Better make it entertaining.
$CARDG_QST_07_0400_0100_00_leg,"Oh, Cloud! Want to have a bout?"
$CARDG_QST_07_0400_0200_00_leg,"What, you want to have a bout with me? Guess I don't have a choice."
$CARDG_QST_07_0400_0300_00_leg,Really? You're backing out?
$CARDG_QST_07_0500_0100_00_leg,"Winning feels absolutely amazing, doesn't it?"
$CARDG_QST_07_0500_0200_00_leg,"Well, that's just how it goes. Want a rematch if you're feeling frustrated?"
$CARDG_QST_07_0500_0300_00_leg,"A tie? No way, I'm not okay with that!"
$CARDG_QST_07_0500_0400_00_leg,"I'm frustrated, but that was fun. Let's play again sometime."
$CARDG_QST_07_0500_0500_00_leg,"Hmm, maybe my deck's balance is off. I need to study more."
$CARDG_QST_08_0100_0100_00_shd,Ugh... I'm scared... but I want to battle.
$CARDG_QST_08_0100_0200_00_shd,Ugh… Should I just go up and talk to someone? But what if I lose?
$CARDG_QST_08_0100_0300_00_shd,Ugh... I wish a weak bouter would talk to me first.
$CARDG_QST_08_0200_0100_00_shd,"Whoa, wh-wh-what's going on!? You scared me!"
$CARDG_QST_08_0200_0200_00_shd,"Are you here for Queen's Blood? Oh no... Just look at you, you look really strong."
$CARDG_QST_08_0200_0300_00_shd,Ugh... I'm so scared.
$CARDG_QST_08_0200_0400_00_shd,"Oh, that look on your face... You're shocked to see an adult crying so suddenly, aren't you."
$CARDG_QST_08_0200_0500_00_shd,Ugh... Everyone calls me Crybaby Ned.
$CARDG_QST_08_0200_0600_00_shd,"The more I cry, the stronger I get! Ugh... Let's have a duel, please!"
$CARDG_QST_08_0200_0700_00_shd,"Ugh... You don't want to play with a crybaby, huh?"
$CARDG_QST_08_0200_0800_00_shd,"Ugh... You're back again. I'm scared, but I don't want to lose!"
$CARDG_QST_08_0200_0900_00_shd,Wh-wh-what!? You want to have a bout?
$CARDG_QST_08_0400_0100_00_hem,"A little lady who truly loves Queen's Blood, huh?"
$CARDG_QST_08_0400_0200_00_nen,Yeah... I do.
$CARDG_QST_08_0400_0300_00_hem,"Alright, who are we gonna take on next?"
$CARDG_QST_08_0400_0400_00_hem,How about those new cards you got? Getting the hang of them?
$CARDG_QST_08_0400_0500_00_nen,Hmm... it's tough.
$CARDG_QST_08_0400_0600_00_hem,"Don't be scared, just keep using them and you'll get better."
$CARDG_QST_08_0500_0100_00_hem,"Oh, looks like we've got a new challenger!"
$CARDG_QST_08_0500_0110_00_hem,"Hey there, buddy.<br>You up for a bout?"
$CARDG_QST_08_0500_0200_00_hem,"This girl here is called Nene, the ventriloquist."
$CARDG_QST_08_0500_0300_00_hem,"She might be a bit shy, but when it counts, she really comes through.<br>Don't underestimate her, she's a growing contender!"
$CARDG_QST_08_0500_0400_00_hem,"Underestimate her, and you'll regret it!"
$CARDG_QST_08_0500_0500_00_hem,"What, are you scared?"
$CARDG_QST_08_0500_0600_00_hem,"Oh, you came at the right time.<br>How about playing a game with this girl?"
$CARDG_QST_08_0500_0700_00_hem,"Hey buddy, if you've got some free time, why not have a bout with her?"
$CARDG_QST_08_0600_0100_00_hem,"Ah, we lost that one.<br>Well, it happens sometimes."
$CARDG_QST_08_0600_0200_00_hem,You took on a strong opponent.<br>Don't ever forget that fighting spirit.
$CARDG_QST_08_0600_0300_00_hem,You can't get stronger if you're afraid of losing.
$CARDG_QST_08_0600_0400_00_hem,"I witnessed your explosive spirit, kid."
$CARDG_QST_08_0600_0410_00_hem,"Now, go thank the guy who played with you."
$CARDG_QST_08_0600_0500_00_nen,Thank you for the match.
$CARDG_QST_08_0600_0600_00_hem,See that? Our little girl showed some real skills.
$CARDG_QST_08_0600_0700_00_hem,Haha! How about that?<br>That's the explosive power of our girl!
$CARDG_QST_08_0600_0800_00_hem,Drawing against our little girl?<br>Not bad at all!
$CARDG_QST_08_0600_0900_00_nen,I learned a lot.<br>Please play with me again.
$CARDG_QST_08_0600_1000_00_nen,Thank you for playing with me!
$CARDG_QST_08_0700_0100_00_gvr,"Hehehe, what a beautiful wall. It feels so reassuring to be surrounded by these walls."
$CARDG_QST_08_0700_0200_00_gvr,I wish I could be as strong and steadfast as these towering walls.
$CARDG_QST_08_0700_0300_00_gvr,"Compared to Kalm's walls, these bowers seem so fragile."
$CARDG_QST_08_0800_0100_00_gvr,How rude of you to break through my barricade.
$CARDG_QST_08_0800_0200_00_gvr,"Are you here to admire Kalm's wall, too?"
$CARDG_QST_08_0800_0300_00_gvr,Or maybe you'd like to challenge me and the Queen's Blood?
$CARDG_QST_08_0800_0400_00_gvr,"I'm Zahira, the Iron Wall."
$CARDG_QST_08_0800_0500_00_gvr,"As unyielding and elegant as Kalm's wall, I stand firm and defend with grace."
$CARDG_QST_08_0800_0600_00_gvr,No one has ever faced me and walked away unscathed.
$CARDG_QST_08_0800_0610_00_gvr,"If you're not fully committed, better think twice before taking me on."
$CARDG_QST_08_0800_0700_00_gvr,The wall isn't going anywhere. Come back anytime.
$CARDG_QST_08_0800_0800_00_gvr,Have you studied Kalm's wall?
$CARDG_QST_08_0800_0900_00_gvr,"Now that I've mastered offense in addition to defense, I'm even stronger."
$CARDG_QST_08_0900_0100_00_gvr,Impossible... How could you break through my impregnable defense? Who are you?
$CARDG_QST_08_0900_0200_00_gvr,"Deep down, I always knew... I couldn't stay hiding behind these walls forever."
$CARDG_QST_08_0900_0300_00_gvr,"These walls keep me safe... But one day, I'll have to surpass them."
$CARDG_QST_08_0900_0400_00_gvr,"Alright, I've decided. From today on, you will be my wall!"
$CARDG_QST_08_0900_0500_00_gvr,"I will definitely overcome you, so be prepared."
$CARDG_QST_08_0900_0600_00_gvr,Seems the wall was too high for you.
$CARDG_QST_08_0900_0700_00_gvr,You should learn how to guard yourself from a wall.
$CARDG_QST_08_0900_0800_00_gvr,A perfect match... Well done.
$CARDG_QST_08_0900_0900_00_gvr,"The higher the barrier, the more it ignites my spirit."
$CARDG_QST_08_0900_1000_00_gvr,Impressive. You make me want to challenge you even more.
$CARDG_QST_09_0100_0100_00_dem,"Hey, bro! I think we can beat that guy!"
$CARDG_QST_09_0100_0200_00_dam,"Yeah, maybe we can, but I don't think he's got any money."
$CARDG_QST_09_0100_0300_00_dam,"Listen, we need to find someone who looks weak and has money."
$CARDG_QST_09_0100_0400_00_dem,Right! We beat them and get a reward!
$CARDG_QST_09_0200_0100_00_dam,"Hey there, mister! Looking for someone to play a bout with?"
$CARDG_QST_09_0200_0110_00_dam,"If so, we can be your opponents."
$CARDG_QST_09_0200_0200_00_dem,"I'm Devin, the younger brother."
$CARDG_QST_09_0200_0300_00_dam,"And I'm Darren, the older brother."
$CARDG_QST_09_0200_0400_00_dem,"Together, we're the 'Moore Twins'! The twin card battlers."
$CARDG_QST_09_0200_0500_00_dam,"First, you battle my little brother. If you win, then you get to challenge me."
$CARDG_QST_09_0200_0510_00_dam,"Two battles for the price of one, what a deal!"
$CARDG_QST_09_0200_0600_00_dem,"But if you lose to either of us, you'll owe us three gil!"
$CARDG_QST_09_0200_0700_00_dem,Feel free to challenge us anytime!
$CARDG_QST_09_0200_0800_00_dam,"Sorry, but no gil, no game."
$CARDG_QST_09_0200_0900_00_dam,"Wanna play a match? If you lose, it'll cost you three gil."
$CARDG_QST_09_0200_1000_00_dem,"If you lose, we get three gil from you. Deal?"
$CARDG_QST_09_0300_0100_00_dam,Nice job! Now you'll face me.
$CARDG_QST_09_0300_0200_00_dam,I'll avenge my brother!
$CARDG_QST_09_0300_0300_00_dam,"Wow, we lost. You're really strong, mister."
$CARDG_QST_09_0300_0400_00_dem,"So, we don't get our three gil?"
$CARDG_QST_09_0300_0500_00_dam,"Wait, what happened again?"
$CARDG_QST_09_0300_0600_00_dam,I thought the deal was we'd get three gil if we lost.
$CARDG_QST_09_0300_0700_00_dam,Just kidding!
$CARDG_QST_09_0300_0800_00_dam,"We lost this time, but we'll win next time and get those three gil!"
$CARDG_QST_09_0300_0900_00_dam,Come battle us again when you feel like it!
$CARDG_QST_09_0300_1000_00_dam,Alright! Much appreciated!
$CARDG_QST_09_0300_1100_00_dem,"Okay~ That'll be three gil, please!"
$CARDG_QST_09_0300_1200_00_dam,"Aw man, it's a draw.<br>Mister, could you be happy with just two gil?"
$CARDG_QST_09_0300_1300_00_dam,"Damn, we lost again!"
$CARDG_QST_09_0300_1400_00_dem,"Mister, you're a grown-up, you should go easy on us!"
$CARDG_QST_09_0400_0100_00_isa,Looks like I've taken down all the bounties on this continent.
$CARDG_QST_09_0400_0200_00_isa,It's about time I set out. This continent feels too small for me.
$CARDG_QST_09_0400_0300_00_isa,The sea is calling me. Time to set sail.
$CARDG_QST_09_0500_0100_00_isa,"Looking for a match? Sorry, but I'm about to set sail."
$CARDG_QST_09_0500_0200_00_isa,I’m Isabelle the Sailor. I’m leaving to seek out stronger opponents.
$CARDG_QST_09_0500_0300_00_isa,"The battlers on this continent are all too weak, you see."
$CARDG_QST_09_0500_0400_00_isa,But you look like you’ve got some backbone.
$CARDG_QST_09_0500_0410_00_isa,Interesting. How about we have a match to kick things off?
$CARDG_QST_09_0500_0500_00_isa,"Make sure you're well prepared, because I don’t go easy."
$CARDG_QST_09_0500_0600_00_isa,Don’t disappoint me.
$CARDG_QST_09_0500_0700_00_isa,"I’m always up for a bout with you, anytime."
$CARDG_QST_09_0600_0100_00_isa,Unbelievable... I lost? I didn't think there was anyone out there who could beat me.
$CARDG_QST_09_0600_0200_00_isa,Looks like I got a bit too full of myself.
$CARDG_QST_09_0600_0300_00_isa,I'm glad I got to fight you before heading out to sea.
$CARDG_QST_09_0600_0400_00_isa,"If I'd set sail like this, I would have just sunk under the rough waves."
$CARDG_QST_09_0600_0500_00_isa,Thanks for helping me realize that.
$CARDG_QST_09_0600_0600_00_isa,I'll stay here a bit longer and get my deck back in shape.
$CARDG_QST_09_0600_0700_00_isa,Is this really all there is? That's a disappointment.
$CARDG_QST_09_0600_0800_00_isa,...Looks like I was expecting too much.
$CARDG_QST_09_0600_0900_00_isa,A draw? Beating you would be quite the task.
$CARDG_QST_09_0600_1000_00_isa,Fighting you is the only thing that makes me feel like I'm growing.
$CARDG_QST_09_0600_1100_00_isa,You're the only one who lives up to my expectations.
$CARDG_QST_09_0700_0100_00_zgn,Yaaawn... Not even a nibble.
$CARDG_QST_09_0700_0200_00_zgn,Where are all the lively bouts hiding today...?
$CARDG_QST_09_0700_0300_00_zgn,"If one bites, I'll reel it in all at once!"
$CARDG_QST_09_0800_0100_00_zgn,"Well, well, looks like I've hooked an interesting catch."
$CARDG_QST_09_0800_0200_00_zgn,Did you think an old man like me would be an easy target?
$CARDG_QST_09_0800_0210_00_zgn,"You're naive, kid."
$CARDG_QST_09_0800_0300_00_zgn,"I am Zogan, the master angler."
$CARDG_QST_09_0800_0400_00_zgn,I've skillfully handled and caught plenty of lively fighters before.
$CARDG_QST_09_0800_0500_00_zgn,Let me show you the finesse of an experienced hand against a cocky youngster like you.
$CARDG_QST_09_0800_0600_00_zgn,"No choice, I'll let you go."
$CARDG_QST_09_0800_0700_00_zgn,"Alright, time to reel you in."
$CARDG_QST_09_0800_0800_00_zgn,"Oh, looks like I've got a big one!"
$CARDG_QST_09_0900_0100_00_zgn,I never thought I’d miss my catch!
$CARDG_QST_09_0900_0110_00_zgn,It seems I was the one underestimating you because of your youth.
$CARDG_QST_09_0900_0200_00_zgn,Fishing and card bouts are alike. You gauge the right moment and then make your move.
$CARDG_QST_09_0900_0300_00_zgn,"Get the timing wrong, and victory will slip away."
$CARDG_QST_09_0900_0400_00_zgn,The fish I lost turned out to be a big one. What a pity!
$CARDG_QST_09_0900_0500_00_zgn,It's satisfying to reel in a young bouter like yourself.
$CARDG_QST_09_0900_0600_00_zgn,"Hehehe, I never let my target escape."
$CARDG_QST_09_0900_0700_00_zgn,"Hmm, it seems this time it's a draw."
$CARDG_QST_09_0900_0800_00_zgn,To think I got reeled in instead. Well done.
$CARDG_QST_09_0900_0900_00_zgn,This big fish seems impossible to catch.
$CARDG_QST_10_0100_0100_00_nil,"I'm a wandering carder. Please, lend an ear to my tale!"
$CARDG_QST_10_0100_0200_00_nil,"For twenty years, I was born and raised as a fisherman's son."
$CARDG_QST_10_0100_0300_00_nil,"One day, after a big fight with my nagging old man, I stormed out of that fishy-smelling house."
$CARDG_QST_10_0100_0400_00_nil,"Sorry, Pops, I've got dreams of my own!"
$CARDG_QST_10_0100_0500_00_nil,"I found Queen's Blood and my guitar, and there's no turning back."
$CARDG_QST_10_0100_0600_00_nil,"No more fishing for me, I'm aiming for the Gold Saucer stage!"
$CARDG_QST_10_0100_0700_00_nil,"From now on, I'll live by my own talents."
$CARDG_QST_10_0100_0800_00_nil,"Today, I'll mesmerize you all with my music and card battles!"
$CARDG_QST_10_0200_0100_00_nil,"What’s this, are you a scout or something?"
$CARDG_QST_10_0200_0200_00_nil,Did you come all the way out here because you heard there’s a singing brawler?
$CARDG_QST_10_0200_0300_00_nil,"Well, it depends on the conditions, but if you insist, I might consider debuting."
$CARDG_QST_10_0200_0350_00_cld,No...
$CARDG_QST_10_0200_0400_00_nil,Wham!
$CARDG_QST_10_0200_0500_00_nil,So you're not a scout? That’s confusing!
$CARDG_QST_10_0200_0600_00_nil,"I'm Neil, the wanderer. One day, I’ll be a big-shot guitarist brawler!"
$CARDG_QST_10_0200_0700_00_nil,You’ll be able to boast someday if you have a bout with me now!
$CARDG_QST_10_0200_0800_00_nil,At least stay and listen to my performance.
$CARDG_QST_10_0200_0900_00_nil,"After enjoying the music, it’s bout time!"
$CARDG_QST_10_0200_1000_00_nil,"Someday, you'll be able to boast about having a match with me."
$CARDG_QST_10_0300_0100_00_nil,Gah! I lost!
$CARDG_QST_10_0300_0200_00_nil,"Now that I think about it, I hardly ever win. Maybe I just don’t have the talent."
$CARDG_QST_10_0300_0300_00_nil,I hear it...
$CARDG_QST_10_0300_0400_00_nil,"It's an intense chord progression, like it's uplifting the loser. A melody is coming to me."
$CARDG_QST_10_0300_0500_00_nil,"I knew it, I am a genius guitarist. A defeat like this just adds to my artistic growth."
$CARDG_QST_10_0300_0600_00_nil,"Thanks to you, I feel like a great song is on its way."
$CARDG_QST_10_0300_0700_00_nil,Someday I'll make it big and give my parents the good life they deserve.
$CARDG_QST_10_0300_0800_00_nil,"Until then, I'll keep fighting with my guitar and cards."
$CARDG_QST_10_0300_0900_00_nil,"Well, don't feel too down. Want me to give you an autograph?"
$CARDG_QST_10_0300_1000_00_nil,Strong in battles and great at guitar─it's only a matter of time before a scout finds me.
$CARDG_QST_10_0300_1100_00_nil,I'm glad I got to tie with a future star.
$CARDG_QST_10_0300_1200_00_nil,"It's great! The more I lose, the more great songs I come up with."
$CARDG_QST_10_0300_1300_00_nil,I'll channel this frustration into my guitar.
$CARDG_QST_10_0400_0100_00_mis,"Hello, everyone! I'm Misery from the Anti-Shinra Youth Group."
$CARDG_QST_10_0400_0200_00_mis,We are working to spread Queen's Blood to bring peace to the world.
$CARDG_QST_10_0400_0300_00_mis,May I have a moment of your time?
$CARDG_QST_10_0400_0400_00_mis,"In my opinion, there is no better game for negotiation than Queen's Blood."
$CARDG_QST_10_0400_0500_00_mis,"Facing each other at the table, playing cards—that's what negotiation is, don't you think?"
$CARDG_QST_10_0400_0600_00_mis,I'm sure there are Queen's Blood players within Shinra too.
$CARDG_QST_10_0400_0700_00_mis,"If we use Queen's Blood, I'm certain that even Shinra will sit at the table."
$CARDG_QST_10_0400_0800_00_mis,Let's use the game as a way to talk to Shinra.
$CARDG_QST_10_0400_0900_00_mis,"How about it, everyone? Would you like to play a match against me and experience Queen's Blood for yourselves?"
$CARDG_QST_10_0400_1000_00_mis,Let's channel our feelings into our cards and make Shinra hear us!
$CARDG_QST_10_0500_0100_00_mis,Hello!
$CARDG_QST_10_0500_0200_00_mis,"I'm Michaela, a member of the Anti-Shinra Youth Group and part of the Queen's Blood Promotion Committee."
$CARDG_QST_10_0500_0300_00_mis,We're working to spread awareness about Queen's Blood to everyone.
$CARDG_QST_10_0500_0400_00_mis,"In the future, we plan to use Card Bout to negotiate with Shinra."
$CARDG_QST_10_0500_0500_00_mis,Please help us by supporting our awareness campaign!
$CARDG_QST_10_0500_0600_00_mis,"You're always welcome, so feel free to talk to me anytime you're interested!"
$CARDG_QST_10_0500_0700_00_mis,Let's spread the word about Queen's Blood together!
$CARDG_QST_10_0500_0800_00_mis,Let's bring peace to the world through Card Bout!
$CARDG_QST_10_0600_0100_00_mis,Excellent!
$CARDG_QST_10_0600_0110_00_mis,It feels like we've truly connected by exchanging cards at the table.
$CARDG_QST_10_0600_0200_00_mis,"From now on, you are a comrade, a member of the Queen's Blood Promotion Committee!"
$CARDG_QST_10_0600_0300_00_mis,"I believe that through Queen's Blood, I can become friends with anyone."
$CARDG_QST_10_0600_0400_00_mis,"To lead the world to peace, we need play, not force."
$CARDG_QST_10_0600_0500_00_mis,"Comrade, spread this fun game all over the world through your bouts!"
$CARDG_QST_10_0600_0600_00_mis,I'm counting on you!
$CARDG_QST_10_0600_0700_00_mis,"Whether you win or lose, you'll make friends through bouts!"
$CARDG_QST_10_0600_0800_00_mis,"We had many conversations through the cards, didn't we?"
$CARDG_QST_10_0600_0900_00_mis,"Phew, that was an intense bout."
$CARDG_QST_10_0600_1000_00_mis,As expected from a comrade. Nice bout.
$CARDG_QST_10_0600_1100_00_mis,"Ugh... Even as comrades, losing still stings."
$CARDG_QST_11_0100_0100_00_moa,"Okay, Riana! Look this way and taunt Bouter."
$CARDG_QST_11_0100_0200_00_moa,"Oh, that expression is perfect! Now, turn your gaze over here."
$CARDG_QST_11_0100_0300_00_moa,"Come on, feel the Costa del Sol sunshine with your whole body!"
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_0100_00_lan,So frustrating!
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_0200_00_moa,"That intense stare, the frustrated frown, the sweat dripping from your forehead... Perfect!"
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_0300_00_moa,I've captured a side of you I've never seen before!
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_0400_00_moa,And you! I never expected to find such a hidden gem out here.
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_0500_00_moa,"Hey, have you ever thought about becoming a model?"
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_0600_00_lan,That sounds like a great idea!
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_0700_00_lan,Let's team up and work together as Card Bout models!
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_0710_00_lan,I think you'd become popular right away.
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_0800_00_cld,No.
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_0850_00_moa,What?!
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_0900_00_lan,"I'll be here taking photos for a while, so feel free to come by if you're up for it."
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_1000_00_lan,"Yay, I won! Got some great shots, thank you!"
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_1100_00_lan,I even captured your frustrated face perfectly.
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_1200_00_lan,"A tie is just a bit dull, isn't it?"
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_1300_00_lan,"Losing is frustrating, but at least it looks like we'll have a good photo collection."
$CARDG_QST_11_0300_1400_00_lan,What a stylish win! You really have the makings of a model.
$CARDG_QST_11_0400_0100_00_dca,"Oh, man, they're all so cute! I can't decide which one to use."
$CARDG_QST_11_0400_0200_00_dca,"I could spend the whole day just putting my deck together. Well, I guess that's part of the fun."
$CARDG_QST_11_0400_0300_00_dca,I wish I could show off my prized cards to someone. Isn't there anyone to battle with?
$CARDG_QST_11_0500_0100_00_dca,You came at the perfect time! How about a match with my beloved cards?
$CARDG_QST_11_0500_0200_00_dca,"I'm Dokaccha, the Devoted. I love my cards, and they love me too. We're like a family."
$CARDG_QST_11_0500_0300_00_dca,There's just one secret to having my cards love you back!
$CARDG_QST_11_0500_0400_00_dca,"Every day, I shower them with affection, saying ""You're so cute"" and ""You're so cool!"""
$CARDG_QST_11_0500_0500_00_dca,"Now, I'd like to praise them with ""You're so strong"" and ""You did great!"" So, let's have a match!"
$CARDG_QST_11_0500_0600_00_dca,I understand not wanting to send your beloved ones into battle. I really do.
$CARDG_QST_11_0500_0700_00_dca,"Alright, let's show him how brave you all are!"
$CARDG_QST_11_0500_0800_00_dca,"Look, he's going to play with you all. Isn't that nice?"
$CARDG_QST_11_0600_0100_00_dca,"My poor, precious babies—oh no!"
$CARDG_QST_11_0600_0200_00_dca,"It's frustrating, but it seems your bond with your cards is stronger than mine."
$CARDG_QST_11_0600_0210_00_dca,What on earth are you saying to them?
$CARDG_QST_11_0600_0300_00_dca,"I see, you're the type who speaks through actions. This is enlightening."
$CARDG_QST_11_0600_0400_00_dca,"Hey, have you heard the rumor about the extremely rare card called the 'Crimson Black Queen'? There's said to be only one in the entire world."
$CARDG_QST_11_0600_0500_00_dca,"If that's true, I'd love to see it just once."
$CARDG_QST_11_0600_0600_00_dca,I bet it's unimaginably beautiful.
$CARDG_QST_11_0600_0700_00_dca,"So, what did you think of my cards? Aren't they all hardworking?"
$CARDG_QST_11_0600_0800_00_dca,How about my prized collection? Aren't they all adorable and powerful?
$CARDG_QST_11_0600_0900_00_dca,I guess that proves there are no superior or inferior cards!
$CARDG_QST_11_0600_1000_00_dca,I can hear the joyous voices of your cards. Make sure to commend them for their efforts.
$CARDG_QST_11_0600_1100_00_dca,Your cards truly trust you. I'm envious.
$CARDG_QST_11_0700_0100_00_mcy,Isn't there anyone out there who can ignite my fighting spirit?
$CARDG_QST_11_0700_0200_00_mcy,I'm tired of dashing on the beach day after day. Can't someone spar with me to break the monotony?
$CARDG_QST_11_0700_0300_00_mcy,"With Queen's Blood, it's okay to rough up the opponent a bit, right?"
$CARDG_QST_11_0800_0100_00_mcy,What? You want to take me on?
$CARDG_QST_11_0800_0200_00_mcy,No need to be so wary. I don't plan on being rough.
$CARDG_QST_11_0800_0300_00_mcy,"I'm Maahir, the 'Child of the Sun.' I'm a boxer currently cutting weight at Costa."
$CARDG_QST_11_0800_0400_00_mcy,"Right now, I'm sharpening my fighting spirit with some Queen's Blood."
$CARDG_QST_11_0800_0500_00_mcy,"Hey, would you mind sparring with me?"
$CARDG_QST_11_0800_0600_00_mcy,"Alright, let me know if you change your mind."
$CARDG_QST_11_0800_0700_00_mcy,Are you here to ignite my fighting spirit?
$CARDG_QST_11_0800_0800_00_mcy,I expect a bout as hot as the sands of Costa.
$CARDG_QST_11_0900_0100_00_mcy,"Ouch! Haha, I hate to admit it, but you knocked me out."
$CARDG_QST_11_0900_0200_00_mcy,"Your defense was flawless, you didn't miss a single opening, and your strikes were both powerful and fast."
$CARDG_QST_11_0900_0300_00_mcy,It was a match as hot and exciting as the sun. You've reignited my fighting spirit.
$CARDG_QST_11_0900_0400_00_mcy,I think I'm ready to compete at my best. Thanks.
$CARDG_QST_11_0900_0500_00_mcy,"I thought you could heat things up even more. But, well, it is what it is."
$CARDG_QST_11_0900_0600_00_mcy,"Somehow, I feel like my excitement has cooled down."
$CARDG_QST_11_0900_0700_00_mcy,"A draw, huh? I feel like it was unfinished business."
$CARDG_QST_11_0900_0800_00_mcy,"Damn, you still put up one hot fight."
$CARDG_QST_11_0900_0900_00_mcy,I caught some of your heat. Thanks a lot.
$CARDG_QST_12_0100_0100_00_rlh,Woof! Woof!
$CARDG_QST_12_0100_0200_00_loc,What's wrong? Stop barking so much.
$CARDG_QST_12_0100_0300_00_loc,Could it be that you smell a Card Battler?
$CARDG_QST_12_0200_0100_00_rlh,Woof!
$CARDG_QST_12_0200_0200_00_loc,"Oh, sorry about Rolf. He's been restless for a while now."
$CARDG_QST_12_0200_0300_00_loc,"Hey, are you a card battler by any chance?"
$CARDG_QST_12_0200_0400_00_loc,Rolf gets excited and starts barking when he senses a strong battler.
$CARDG_QST_12_0200_0500_00_rlh,Woof!
$CARDG_QST_12_0200_0600_00_loc,This guy is 'Rolf the Dog Fighter.' He's the only dog battler in the world.
$CARDG_QST_12_0200_0700_00_rlh,Woof! Woof!
$CARDG_QST_12_0200_0800_00_loc,"Rolf wants to battle with you. So, what do you say?"
$CARDG_QST_12_0200_0900_00_rlh,Hnnn...
$CARDG_QST_12_0200_1000_00_loc,"Alright, come back if you ever feel like playing."
$CARDG_QST_12_0200_1100_00_loc,Rolf says he wants to challenge you to a match!
$CARDG_QST_12_0200_1200_00_loc,It looks like he's happy to have met you.
$CARDG_QST_12_0300_0100_00_rlh,Whine...
$CARDG_QST_12_0300_0200_00_loc,Uh-oh. Someone's sulking.
$CARDG_QST_12_0300_0300_00_loc,"But what did you think? Rolf is pretty strong, isn't he?"
$CARDG_QST_12_0300_0400_00_loc,"Actually, we're going to be on TV soon. They're doing a special on animals that can battle."
$CARDG_QST_12_0300_0500_00_loc,"Once we get famous, we can leave this village behind!"
$CARDG_QST_12_0300_0600_00_loc,"Let's do our best together, Rolf!"
$CARDG_QST_12_0300_0700_00_rlh,Woof!
$CARDG_QST_12_0300_0800_00_loc,Did you let your guard down because Rolf's a dog?
$CARDG_QST_12_0300_0900_00_loc,Rolf might be able to win tournaments. Imagine the prize money...
$CARDG_QST_12_0300_1000_00_loc,"Rolf says, 'You're not bad for a human.' He'd love to play another round if you're up for it!"
$CARDG_QST_12_0300_1100_00_loc,"Hmm, I guess I'll need to train harder before appearing on TV."
$CARDG_QST_12_0300_1200_00_loc,"Rolf is much stronger than me, and he lost. You're not just anybody, are you?"
$CARDG_QST_12_0400_0100_00_bga,The terrifying Buggler himself is here!
$CARDG_QST_12_0400_0200_00_bga,"Prepare to witness an outlaw fight! And if you lose, you're leaving with nothing!"
$CARDG_QST_12_0400_0300_00_bga,"Hehehe. I'm such an outlaw, no one dares come near me!"
$CARDG_QST_12_0500_0100_00_bga,"What the hell, punk? Do you even know who I am?"
$CARDG_QST_12_0500_0200_00_bga,I'm such a badass that I got kicked out of Beck's gang of outlaws in Midgar for being too much of a troublemaker!
$CARDG_QST_12_0500_0210_00_bga,That's right! I'm the infamous Biff the Outsider!
$CARDG_QST_12_0500_0300_00_bga,What? You scared yet?
$CARDG_QST_12_0500_0400_00_bga,"Oh, you're pretty gutsy..."
$CARDG_QST_12_0500_0500_00_bga,"Alright then, let's settle this with a bout!"
$CARDG_QST_12_0500_0600_00_bga,"If you lose, you owe me three... no, seven gil!"
$CARDG_QST_12_0500_0700_00_bga,"What, are you chickening out?"
$CARDG_QST_12_0500_0800_00_bga,Huh? You telling me you don't even have seven gil?
$CARDG_QST_12_0500_0810_00_bga,"Oh. Uh... sorry, man."
$CARDG_QST_12_0500_0900_00_bga,"Hey, you wanna challenge me? Don't forget, you'll owe me seven gil if you lose!"
$CARDG_QST_12_0500_1000_00_bga,"I'm Biff, the legend! Got it? Lose, and you owe me seven gil!"
$CARDG_QST_12_0600_0100_00_bga,"Aaaah, I lost!"
$CARDG_QST_12_0600_0200_00_bga,"The truth is, I ran away because I couldn't stand being a thief."
$CARDG_QST_12_0600_0300_00_bga,"So I decided to clean up my act and become a card player, but I can't win at all."
$CARDG_QST_12_0600_0400_00_bga,"Hey, how can I get stronger? Tell me."
$CARDG_QST_12_0600_0500_00_bga,"What, you don't want to teach me for free? What a greedy jerk!"
$CARDG_QST_12_0600_0600_00_bga,"Damn it, remember this! When we meet next, I'm taking seven gil from you!"
$CARDG_QST_12_0600_0800_00_bga,Hehehe... That's what you get when you face the great Biff.
$CARDG_QST_12_0600_0900_00_bga,Kekeke... I'm going to enjoy some good drinks tonight.
$CARDG_QST_12_0600_1000_00_bga,A tie? Damn it!
$CARDG_QST_12_0600_1100_00_bga,Maybe I really don't have any talent.
$CARDG_QST_12_0600_1200_00_bga,Maybe I should quit card battling too.
$CARDG_QST_13_0100_0100_00_pop,"Come and see the statue that performs in bouts! Have a look, everyone!"
$CARDG_QST_13_0100_0200_00_pop,"Enjoy the show, and if you like it, feel free to leave a tip!"
$CARDG_QST_13_0100_0300_00_pop,"Look, look! It won't move a muscle!"
$CARDG_QST_13_0200_0100_00_pop,Huh? What is it? I'm in the middle of a performance right now.
$CARDG_QST_13_0200_0200_00_pop,Could it be...you want to play Queen's Blood?
$CARDG_QST_13_0200_0210_00_pop,"Hmm, that's a problem... I'm known as Poppy the Unmovable. I'm not supposed to move."
$CARDG_QST_13_0200_0300_00_pop,I guess I'll just have to free my arms then.
$CARDG_QST_13_0200_0400_00_pop,"Heh, heh, heh... You'll regret making me move."
$CARDG_QST_13_0200_0500_00_pop,"Well then, I'll return to my performance."
$CARDG_QST_13_0200_0600_00_pop,Would you like to have a bout?
$CARDG_QST_13_0200_0700_00_pop,It seems it's time for me to move my arms again.
$CARDG_QST_13_0300_0100_00_pop,"You got me, big bro. That was impressive."
$CARDG_QST_13_0300_0200_00_pop,"But my performance wasn’t too shabby either, right?"
$CARDG_QST_13_0300_0300_00_pop,"One day, I hope to become a performer exclusively at the Gold Saucer."
$CARDG_QST_13_0300_0400_00_pop,"To reach that goal, I'm intentionally putting myself in tough situations to hone my skills."
$CARDG_QST_13_0300_0500_00_pop,"But maybe it's good I lost, since my winning streak was starting to make me stand out in a bad way."
$CARDG_QST_13_0300_0600_00_pop,"I'll be here for a while, so if you feel like playing again, just give me a shout."
$CARDG_QST_13_0300_0700_00_pop,No one can beat me once I unleash my true potential.
$CARDG_QST_13_0300_0800_00_pop,"Hehe... That was unexpected, wasn’t it?"
$CARDG_QST_13_0300_0900_00_pop,To draw with me when I'm at my best? Nicely done.
$CARDG_QST_13_0300_1000_00_pop,"I'm the unmovable Poppino. No matter how upsetting a loss might be, I won't show it."
$CARDG_QST_13_0300_1100_00_pop,It takes some skill to beat me when I'm using my full strength. Well done.
$CARDG_QST_13_0400_0100_00_rum,"Hey, hey! Anyone up for a game to go with our drinks?"
$CARDG_QST_13_0400_0200_00_rum,"The more I drink, the stronger I get. That's my secret to winning!"
$CARDG_QST_13_0400_0300_00_rum,"Aww, I want to have some fun, but there's no one interesting to play with."
$CARDG_QST_13_0500_0100_00_rum,"Hm...? Ooh, a handsome guy!"
$CARDG_QST_13_0500_0200_00_rum,"Talking to me means you want to drink with me, right?"
$CARDG_QST_13_0500_0300_00_rum,"Hmm, refusing, huh? Then let's settle this with Queen's Blood."
$CARDG_QST_13_0500_0400_00_rum,"Hehe, bad luck for you to talk to me while I'm drinking."
$CARDG_QST_13_0500_0410_00_rum,I'm 'Tipsy Mary.' No one can escape me when I'm drunk.
$CARDG_QST_13_0500_0500_00_rum,"Now, choose: a drink or a bout?"
$CARDG_QST_13_0500_0600_00_rum,"Oh, nice drinking!"
$CARDG_QST_13_0500_0610_00_rum,"Don't worry, it's just a health juice."
$CARDG_QST_13_0500_0700_00_rum,"Well then, you can go this time!"
$CARDG_QST_13_0500_0800_00_rum,"Alrighty, off you go!"
$CARDG_QST_13_0500_0900_00_rum,"So, what'll it be? A drink or a bout?"
$CARDG_QST_13_0500_1000_00_rum,"Back for more, I see. What will it be? A drink or a bout?"
$CARDG_QST_13_0600_0100_00_rum,Oh no! I lost.<br>Maybe I didn't drink enough.
$CARDG_QST_13_0600_0200_00_rum,"Hey, listen up."
$CARDG_QST_13_0600_0300_00_rum,"You know, the more I drink, the stronger I get.<br>But lately, I've been cutting back on booze just a bit."
$CARDG_QST_13_0600_0400_00_rum,"A while back, I drank too much and had a scary dream during a bout."
$CARDG_QST_13_0600_0500_00_rum,I dreamed a strange man was talking to me.
$CARDG_QST_13_0600_0600_00_rum,"So, I'm not at my best today!"
$CARDG_QST_13_0600_0700_00_rum,"Next time, I'll be way drunker, so beware."
$CARDG_QST_13_0600_0800_00_rum,"Hehehe, let's have a celebratory drink."
$CARDG_QST_13_0600_0900_00_rum,"When I drink, my mind works faster.<br>You should try it when you fight."
$CARDG_QST_13_0600_1000_00_rum,Yawn... now I'm sleepy.
$CARDG_QST_13_0600_1100_00_rum,"Oh, I'm so frustrated! One more match, okay?"
$CARDG_QST_13_0600_1200_00_rum,"Since you won, you have to join me for a drink to drown my sorrows."
$CARDG_QST_13_0700_0100_00_dus,Why is everyone avoiding me? I just want to play Card Bout.
$CARDG_QST_13_0700_0200_00_dus,Do they all really dislike me?
$CARDG_QST_13_0700_0300_00_dus,Is it because I'm too greedy?
$CARDG_QST_13_0700_0400_00_dus,"I went to the trouble of building this deck, but no one will play with me."
$CARDG_QST_13_0800_0100_00_dus,Huh? What do you want?
$CARDG_QST_13_0800_0200_00_dus,"Ah, crap! Habit kicked in, sorry about that."
$CARDG_QST_13_0800_0300_00_dus,"Wait, don't leave! I just want to play some Queen's Blood!"
$CARDG_QST_13_0800_0400_00_dus,"I'm not good at talking to people... plus, I look like this..."
$CARDG_QST_13_0800_0500_00_dus,No one wants to play with me.
$CARDG_QST_13_0800_0600_00_dus,"My name's Dax. Please, play a round with me!"
$CARDG_QST_13_0800_0700_00_dus,"Oh, I see. You're avoiding me too."
$CARDG_QST_13_0800_0800_00_dus,Let's play again sometime!
$CARDG_QST_13_0800_0900_00_dus,"What is it? If you're just here to mess around, then scram."
$CARDG_QST_13_0800_1000_00_dus,"Hey, how's it going? Want to play a round? If not, that's okay."
$CARDG_QST_13_0900_0100_00_dus,It's fun to fight people.
$CARDG_QST_13_0900_0200_00_dus,"You can't afford to be underestimated in Corel Prison, can you?"
$CARDG_QST_13_0900_0210_00_dus,So I've always tried to act tough and intimidate everyone to survive.
$CARDG_QST_13_0900_0300_00_dus,"As a result, no one wanted to come near me."
$CARDG_QST_13_0900_0400_00_dus,All I wanted was to play cards.
$CARDG_QST_13_0900_0500_00_dus,I even resented others for not understanding me.
$CARDG_QST_13_0900_0600_00_dus,But I need to change myself first.
$CARDG_QST_13_0900_0610_00_dus,You had the courage to speak to me.
$CARDG_QST_13_0900_0700_00_dus,I should start talking to others instead of just waiting.
$CARDG_QST_13_0900_0800_00_dus,Woohoo! I won!
$CARDG_QST_13_0900_0900_00_dus,So this is what victory tastes like. I'm so happy!
$CARDG_QST_13_0900_1000_00_dus,A draw isn't bad either.
$CARDG_QST_13_0900_1100_00_dus,"Lately, I've found some buddies to play bouts with. It's all thanks to you. I appreciate it."
$CARDG_QST_13_0900_1200_00_dus,What do you think? Have I changed a little?
$CARDG_QST_14_0100_0200_00_zaz,"Ow, my back... You kids sure have a lot of energy."
$CARDG_QST_14_0100_0300_00_zaz,I'll just take it easy here for a bit. Maybe someone will come by for a round of cards.
$CARDG_QST_14_0200_0200_00_zaz,"Come now, you're scaring the poor guy."
$CARDG_QST_14_0200_0300_00_zaz,Sorry for all the commotion.
$CARDG_QST_14_0200_0400_00_zaz,"I'm Zhijun, a laid-back farmer. I'm taking a break now because I hurt my back."
$CARDG_QST_14_0200_0500_00_zaz,"Hey, would you mind playing a bout with me?"
$CARDG_QST_14_0200_0600_00_zaz,"Relaxing in the sun is nice, but at this rate, I'll fall asleep."
$CARDG_QST_14_0200_0700_00_zaz,I'll be here waiting.
$CARDG_QST_14_0200_0800_00_zaz,"Haha, sorry again for the noise."
$CARDG_QST_14_0200_0900_00_zaz,"How about a nice, relaxing match?"
$CARDG_QST_14_0300_0200_00_zaz,"Well, aren't you strong! You were so fast, I couldn't keep up at all."
$CARDG_QST_14_0300_0300_00_zaz,"So this is the latest bout, huh? A lot has changed while I've been taking it easy."
$CARDG_QST_14_0300_0400_00_zaz,"Yeah, that's how young people should be. Keep getting stronger like that."
$CARDG_QST_14_0300_0500_00_zaz,You can settle down and take your time when you get older and your back starts hurting.
$CARDG_QST_14_0300_0600_00_zaz,"When you're young, you should work hard without holding back."
$CARDG_QST_14_0300_0700_00_zaz,"If you ever get tired and want to take it easy, come visit me again."
$CARDG_QST_14_0300_0900_00_zaz,"Oh wow, I can't believe I won. Maybe my back will feel better if my luck keeps up."
$CARDG_QST_14_0300_1000_00_zaz,Don't rush. Take your time to think it over.
$CARDG_QST_14_0300_1100_00_zaz,Did you manage to relax a little?
$CARDG_QST_14_0300_1200_00_zaz,That was fun. Thanks a lot.
$CARDG_QST_14_0300_1300_00_zaz,"You've gotten even stronger, haven't you?"
$CARDG_QST_14_0400_0100_00_osc,Kweh!
$CARDG_QST_14_0400_0200_00_run,"What's the matter, Oscar? Want to have a match?"
$CARDG_QST_14_0400_0300_00_run,"Alright, alright. I'll find you an opponent, but then you have to get back to work."
$CARDG_QST_14_0500_0100_00_run,"Hey, you there!"
$CARDG_QST_14_0500_0200_00_run,You have the demeanor of a skilled card battler.
$CARDG_QST_14_0500_0210_00_run,"Oscar, good news! I've found an opponent for you!"
$CARDG_QST_14_0500_0300_00_osc,Kweh!
$CARDG_QST_14_0500_0400_00_run,"This is Oscar the Swift, a chocobo from the local watch."
$CARDG_QST_14_0500_0500_00_run,"Oscar loves card battles, and if he doesn't get to play at least once a day, he gets cranky."
$CARDG_QST_14_0500_0600_00_run,Would you mind playing a match with him?
$CARDG_QST_14_0500_0700_00_run,I see you're busy.
$CARDG_QST_14_0500_0800_00_osc,Kweh...
$CARDG_QST_14_0500_0900_00_run,"Please, would you play against Oscar?"
$CARDG_QST_14_0500_1000_00_run,Are you up for a bout?
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_0100_00_run,Whoa! I've never seen Oscar lose before. What a surprise.
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_0200_00_osc,Kweh...!
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_0300_00_run,"Hehe, he seems a bit upset about it. Anyway, thanks for the match."
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_0400_00_run,It really helps us out since he's a handful when he's sulking.
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_0400_05_run,"Oscar, you good boy..."
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_0500_00_run,"Actually, he's going to be on TV soon."
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_0600_00_run,He's going to compete against a dog that's good at Queen's Blood.
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_0700_00_run,We absolutely need him to win to promote Gongaga.
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_0800_00_osc,Kweh!
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_0900_00_run,"Yeah, let's do our best together."
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_1000_00_run,"Oscar here is pretty strong, don't you think?"
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_1100_00_run,"Oscar is fast not just on his feet, but in matches too."
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_1200_00_run,"It was such a close match, I almost shouted 'Quack!' out of excitement."
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_1300_00_run,He looks really happy about having a fun match.
$CARDG_QST_14_0600_1400_00_run,"After a match, whether he wins or loses, he's always in a great mood."
$CARDG_QST_15_0200_0100_00_rbn,Hello there.
$CARDG_QST_15_0200_0200_00_cld,Is that Shinra Sign Language?
$CARDG_QST_15_0200_0300_00_rbn,You can understand it?
$CARDG_QST_15_0200_0400_00_cld,I used to be with SOLDIER.
$CARDG_QST_15_0200_0500_00_cld,Shinra Sign Language borrows military hand signals.
$CARDG_QST_15_0200_0510_00_cld,I can understand a bit of it.
$CARDG_QST_15_0200_0600_00_cld,"Playing cards, huh?"
$CARDG_QST_15_0200_0700_00_rbn,"Oh, that's a pity."
$CARDG_QST_15_0200_0800_00_rbn,Care for a game?
$CARDG_QST_15_0200_0900_00_rbn,Would you like to play against me?
$CARDG_QST_15_0300_0100_00_rbn,"It's frustrating, but I lost."
$CARDG_QST_15_0300_0200_00_cld,It was a good match.
$CARDG_QST_15_0300_0300_00_cld,"Are you an ex-soldier, by any chance?"
$CARDG_QST_15_0300_0400_00_rbn,"Yes, I lost my voice during the war."
$CARDG_QST_15_0300_0500_00_rbn,"Now, I'm trying to spread the use of this sign language through duels."
$CARDG_QST_15_0300_0510_00_rbn,I want everyone to know about it.
$CARDG_QST_15_0300_0600_00_cld,I see. Keep it up.
$CARDG_QST_15_0300_0700_00_rbn,Thank you.
$CARDG_QST_15_0300_0800_00_rbn,Thank you for the match.
$CARDG_QST_15_0300_0900_00_rbn,It was a good match. Thank you.
$CARDG_QST_15_0300_1000_00_rbn,"Darn it, I lost."
$CARDG_QST_15_0300_1100_00_rbn,I lost. You're as strong as ever.
$CARDG_QST_15_0400_0100_00_bur,"Hello, everyone! How are your bouts going?"
$CARDG_QST_15_0400_0200_00_bur,Today's 'Search for the Ultimate Bout Master!' is brought to you from Cosmo Canyon!
$CARDG_QST_15_0400_0300_00_bur,"Now then, what kind of bout masters will we meet this time?"
$CARDG_QST_15_0400_0310_00_bur,Let's investigate right away!
$CARDG_QST_15_0400_0400_00_bur,"Come on, are there any challengers out there who think they’ve got what it takes?"
$CARDG_QST_15_0500_0100_00_bur,"Oh, we have a challenger approaching! Let's have a quick word with them."
$CARDG_QST_15_0500_0200_00_bur,"First off, can you tell us your name?"
$CARDG_QST_15_0500_0300_00_bur,"Haha, you seem a bit nervous."
$CARDG_QST_15_0500_0400_00_bur,"But I can tell, from all the fighters I've seen, that you're no ordinary contender."
$CARDG_QST_15_0500_0500_00_bur,You are definitely someone special.
$CARDG_QST_15_0500_0600_00_bur,This is getting interesting!
$CARDG_QST_15_0500_0700_00_bur,No need for more words. Let's show your skills!
$CARDG_QST_15_0500_0800_00_bur,"As for your opponent, it will be none other than me, Bernard 'The Talker'!"
$CARDG_QST_15_0500_0900_00_bur,"Taking a break already? No worries, we'll wait as long as you need."
$CARDG_QST_15_0500_1000_00_bur,Here comes the challenger! Let's get this bout started!
$CARDG_QST_15_0500_1100_00_bur,"Oh, the strongest bouncer has returned. Could it be that you're ready for another fight?"
$CARDG_QST_15_0600_0100_00_bur,Did everyone catch that?
$CARDG_QST_15_0600_0110_00_bur,I couldn't do a thing! We've finally found the strongest brawler!
$CARDG_QST_15_0600_0200_00_bur,This newcomer appeared like a comet and must have shocked brawlers around the world!
$CARDG_QST_15_0600_0300_00_bur,His appearance could cause a revolution in the Queensblood world.
$CARDG_QST_15_0600_0310_00_bur,That's how I feel!
$CARDG_QST_15_0600_0400_00_bur,Thank you for the amazing bout today!
$CARDG_QST_15_0600_0500_00_bur,"We may have found the strongest brawler, but the broadcast is far from over!"
$CARDG_QST_15_0600_0600_00_bur,Please stay tuned and enjoy!
$CARDG_QST_15_0600_0700_00_bur,"Oh no, that's a shame. Please try again."
$CARDG_QST_15_0600_0800_00_bur,"Even though you missed out on the win, it was a superb bout!"
$CARDG_QST_15_0600_0900_00_bur,"It looks like we're just getting started, huh?"
$CARDG_QST_15_0600_1000_00_bur,Incredible... You're just too strong! How much stronger can this man get?
$CARDG_QST_15_0600_1100_00_bur,Whoa! Another legend of ultimate strength has been born!
$CARDG_QST_15_0700_0100_00_cdn,The stars are speaking to us through the cards.
$CARDG_QST_15_0700_0200_00_cdn,Feel the flow of the Lifestream across the board.
$CARDG_QST_15_0700_0300_00_cdn,"Queen's Blood, let us hear the voice of the stars."
$CARDG_QST_15_0800_0100_00_cdn,"Traveler, it seems you too have fallen under the spell of the Queen's Blood."
$CARDG_QST_15_0800_0200_00_cdn,"Do not worry, there is nothing to fear."
$CARDG_QST_15_0800_0300_00_cdn,"Queen's Blood is also a creation of the stars, a part of the grand flow, the 'whole'."
$CARDG_QST_15_0800_0400_00_cdn,"The cards are prayers, from which ripples spread and become destiny."
$CARDG_QST_15_0800_0500_00_cdn,"Come, join me in a match and touch the will of the stars."
$CARDG_QST_15_0800_0600_00_cdn,Follow your heart's voice.
$CARDG_QST_15_0800_0700_00_cdn,There is nothing to fear. Let us weave a match together.
$CARDG_QST_15_0800_0800_00_cdn,Shall we once again touch the will of the stars?
$CARDG_QST_15_0900_0100_00_cdn,"I see, this is an unexpected outcome."
$CARDG_QST_15_0900_0200_00_cdn,It seems the Lifestream is disturbed.
$CARDG_QST_15_0900_0210_00_cdn,I sense an evil presence in Queen's Blood.
$CARDG_QST_15_0900_0300_00_cdn,"Traveler,"
$CARDG_QST_15_0900_0310_00_cdn,"If you plan to continue down the Bout path, be very careful."
$CARDG_QST_15_0900_0400_00_cdn,I have heard that many Bout players have lost their lives.
$CARDG_QST_15_0900_0500_00_cdn,"Remember, the cards are prayers. Never forget to pray."
$CARDG_QST_15_0900_0600_00_cdn,May the stars guide this person.
$CARDG_QST_15_0900_0700_00_cdn,Do not go against the flow. Let yourself be carried by the cards.
$CARDG_QST_15_0900_0800_00_cdn,There's no need to be afraid. The stars are asking for your prayers.
$CARDG_QST_15_0900_0900_00_cdn,The planet tells us not to judge each other.
$CARDG_QST_15_0900_1000_00_cdn,This outcome must also be the will of the planet.
$CARDG_QST_15_0900_1100_00_cdn,"This too is the planet's guidance, so we must follow."
$CARDG_QST_16_0100_0100_00_dle,Ugh... Ah...
$CARDG_QST_16_0100_0200_00_dle,Queen's...Blood
$CARDG_QST_16_0100_0300_00_dle,Bout...
$CARDG_QST_16_0200_0100_00_dle,Uhh... ahh...
$CARDG_QST_16_0200_0200_00_par,"Come on, Dale. This isn't good."
$CARDG_QST_16_0200_0300_00_par,"If it's Queen's Blood you want, I'll play with you."
$CARDG_QST_16_0200_0400_00_par,Sorry about this.
$CARDG_QST_16_0200_0500_00_par,This is Dale. He really loves card games.
$CARDG_QST_16_0200_0600_00_par,"Actually, would you mind playing a match or two with him if you have time?"
$CARDG_QST_16_0200_0700_00_par,"It seems I'm too weak for him, and he's been looking for a stronger opponent."
$CARDG_QST_16_0200_0800_00_par,"Whenever you have some free time, please play a match with him."
$CARDG_QST_16_0200_0900_00_dle,Uhh... ahh...
$CARDG_QST_16_0200_1000_00_dle,Card battle...
$CARDG_QST_16_0300_0100_00_dle,Ung... ahhh...
$CARDG_QST_16_0300_0200_00_par,"Yeah, yeah, he looks really happy to have fought such a strong opponent."
$CARDG_QST_16_0300_0300_00_dle,Shadow... blood... queen... witch...
$CARDG_QST_16_0300_0400_00_par,"Hey, don't hold him up too much."
$CARDG_QST_16_0300_0500_00_par,Thanks for fighting with him. You really helped us out.
$CARDG_QST_16_0300_0600_00_par,"Wow, I didn't realize how strong Dale is."
$CARDG_QST_16_0300_0700_00_par,"Honestly, I think even I could win against you."
$CARDG_QST_16_0300_0800_00_par,It was so exciting not knowing who'd win until the very end.
$CARDG_QST_16_0300_0900_00_par,I need to learn a lot more if I want to be able to take on Dale.
$CARDG_QST_16_0300_1000_00_par,"Dale can't say it, so I'll thank you in his place. Thank you."
$CARDG_QST_16_0400_0100_00_tur,"Alright, the captain's not around. Looks like we can have a bout now."
$CARDG_QST_16_0400_0200_00_tur,"I've still got some time before roll call. If you're gonna slack off, now's the chance."
$CARDG_QST_16_0400_0300_00_tur,Is there no brave soul willing to join me in slacking off?
$CARDG_QST_16_0500_0100_00_tur,You...!
$CARDG_QST_16_0500_0200_00_tur,Are you... a card player?
$CARDG_QST_16_0500_0300_00_tur,I can tell.
$CARDG_QST_16_0500_0400_00_tur,"You’ve been neglecting your duties, indulging in Queen's Blood, haven't you?"
$CARDG_QST_16_0500_0500_00_tur,"Don't worry, I'm the same way."
$CARDG_QST_16_0500_0510_00_tur,They call me 'Turner the Truant Master'.
$CARDG_QST_16_0500_0600_00_tur,"To hell with the missions, slacking off is the way to go!"
$CARDG_QST_16_0500_0700_00_tur,"Even after throwing away promotions and getting demoted, I kept honing my slacking skills."
$CARDG_QST_16_0500_0800_00_tur,Get ready to experience them firsthand!
$CARDG_QST_16_0500_0900_00_tur,What’s wrong? Not gonna slack off with me?
$CARDG_QST_16_0500_1000_00_tur,Nothing's more fun than slacking off while on duty.
$CARDG_QST_16_0500_1100_00_tur,Got it? Don't tell anyone I'm goofing off.
$CARDG_QST_16_0500_1200_00_tur,"A survey team has been sent to check out the reactor, but I'm not worried."
$CARDG_QST_16_0500_1300_00_tur,I'll keep slacking off no matter what.
$CARDG_QST_16_0600_0100_00_tur,What a skillful display.
$CARDG_QST_16_0600_0200_00_tur,"I can't believe you made me taste defeat, even though I always won in contests during missions."
$CARDG_QST_16_0600_0300_00_tur,Could it be that you're slacking off more than I am?
$CARDG_QST_16_0600_0400_00_tur,I devote every moment outside of roll call to playing card bouts!
$CARDG_QST_16_0600_0410_00_tur,Could it be that... you’re jobless?
$CARDG_QST_16_0600_0500_00_tur,I won't delve deeper into it. There's always someone better.
$CARDG_QST_16_0600_0600_00_tur,It was an honor to battle you. Let's do it again sometime.
$CARDG_QST_16_0600_0700_00_tur,You'll never beat me unless you take slacking off more seriously.
$CARDG_QST_16_0600_0800_00_tur,Aren’t you slacking off enough?
$CARDG_QST_16_0600_0900_00_tur,"Well done, I’m impressed."
$CARDG_QST_16_0600_1000_00_tur,I need to hone my skills in slacking off even more.
$CARDG_QST_16_0600_1100_00_tur,Slacking off isn't achieved in a day. I need to put in more effort.
$CHADL_QST_01_2300_0100_00_chd,Mr. Cloud!
$CHADL_QST_01_2300_0110_00_chd,Thank you for securing the Ancient materia.
$CHADL_QST_01_2300_0200_00_chd,I've already started analyzing the scan data from the terminal.
$CHADL_QST_01_2300_0300_00_chd,Please continue to collect any Ancient materia you come across.
$CHADL_QST_01_2300_0400_00_chd,There's one more thing that concerns me.
$CHADL_QST_01_2300_0410_00_chd,I detected a faint interference wave earlier.
$CHADL_QST_01_2300_0500_00_chd,"I'm not certain yet, but someone might be targeting the Ancient materia."
$CHADL_QST_01_2300_0700_00_cld,What do you mean?
$CHADL_QST_01_2300_0800_00_chd,I'm analyzing it. I'll contact you as soon as I find out more.
$CHADL_QST_02_2300_0100_00_chd,Cloud...? Cloud...!
$CHADL_QST_02_2300_0110_00_chd,"Oh, thank goodness! I got through!"
$CHADL_QST_02_2300_0200_00_cld,What was that?
$CHADL_QST_02_2300_0300_00_chd,"For a moment, I completely lost your location."
$CHADL_QST_02_2300_0400_00_chd,I feared something might have happened to you...
$CHADL_QST_02_2300_0500_00_cld,It's fine. No problem.
$CHADL_QST_02_2300_0600_00_chd,I'm sorry for losing my composure.
$CHADL_QST_02_2300_0700_00_blt,Haha! What's this? Turns out you've got a cute side after all.
$CHADL_QST_02_2300_0800_00_chd,Detecting annoyance within myself due to Barret's teasing.
$CHADL_QST_02_2300_0900_00_cld,"Even if something happens, I'll handle it. There's no need to worry about me."
$CHADL_QST_02_2300_1000_00_chd,Alright...
$CHADL_QST_02_2300_1100_00_chd,"From now on, I'll approach exploration with enhanced security!"
$CHADL_QST_03_3100_0100_00_chd,"Cloud, sir."
$CHADL_QST_03_3100_0110_00_chd,We've received a message from Kid G. Connecting you now.
$CHADL_QST_03_3100_0200_00_kdg,Long time no see! It's Kid G from the Goblin faction!
$CHADL_QST_03_3100_0300_00_kdg,"Sorry for the long wait, but the trial preparation is complete."
$CHADL_QST_03_3100_0400_00_kdg,"If you're after the desert treasure, come to the fortress at the No. 3 Reactor."
$CHADL_QST_03_3100_0500_00_kdg,I'll be waiting for you!
$CHADL_QST_03_3100_0600_00_red,Looks like we're resuming the trial for the hidden treasure.
$CHADL_QST_03_4900_0100_00_chd,"Great job, Cloud!"
$CHADL_QST_03_4900_0110_00_chd,I've detected a landmass that hasn't existed before.
$CHADL_QST_03_4900_0200_00_chd,A new island has actually appeared!
$CHADL_QST_03_4900_0300_00_cld,R-Really?
$CHADL_QST_03_4900_0400_00_chd,Waiting there are otherworldly arms and a mysterious swordsman.
$CHADL_QST_03_4900_0500_00_chd,Who knows what kind of data we can collect on this new island... I can hardly contain my excitement!
$CHADL_QST_03_4900_0600_00_chd,Cloud!
$CHADL_QST_03_4900_0700_00_chd,Our adventure regarding the Ancient Materia is reaching its climax. Please continue exploring the world with me!
$CHADL_QST_04_3100_0100_00_chd,I see.
$CHADL_QST_04_3100_0200_00_chd,"The big guy you mentioned, he’s from 'Genji'—"
$CHADL_QST_04_3100_0300_00_chd,"In other words, he's trying to get the Ancient Materia to regain his power and memories... Right?"
$CHADL_QST_04_3100_0400_00_cld,Probably.
$CHADL_QST_04_3100_0500_00_tif,"So, what exactly are Ancient Materia?"
$CHADL_QST_04_3100_0600_00_chd,"I am still in the process of analyzing it, so I cannot say for certain yet..."
$CHADL_QST_04_3100_0700_00_chd,but it seems to be some kind of armament made from materials not originally found in this dimension.
$CHADL_QST_04_3100_0800_00_chd,Assuming the big guy is from another dimension as well...
$CHADL_QST_04_3100_0900_00_chd,there is a possibility that he might be the original owner of the Ancient Materia.
$CHADL_QST_04_3100_1000_00_blt,"So, should we return it to its rightful owner?"
$CHADL_QST_04_3100_1100_00_chd,"Given the mysterious phenomena we've observed so far, if his original power is restored..."
$CHADL_QST_04_3100_1200_00_chd,It's impossible to predict what effects it could have on this dimension.
$CHADL_QST_04_3100_1300_00_chd,We shouldn't return the Ancient Materia to him without gathering a bit more information.
$CHADL_QST_04_3100_1400_00_chd,"For now, let us retrieve and analyze them ourselves."
$CHADL_QST_05_5100_0100_00_cld,"Chadley, are you alright?"
$CHADL_QST_05_5100_0200_00_chd,"Yes, somehow..."
$CHADL_QST_05_5100_0300_00_cld,"You were there too, right?"
$CHADL_QST_05_5100_0400_00_chd,"Yes, it was definitely me and you there, Cloud."
$CHADL_QST_05_5100_0500_00_chd,It seems that place exists in another dimension separate from here.
$CHADL_QST_05_5100_0600_00_cld,I can't wrap my head around it.
$CHADL_QST_05_5100_0700_00_chd,"Hehe, detecting Cloud's agitation."
$CHADL_QST_05_5100_0800_00_chd,I feel even more motivated to uncover this mystery.
$CHADL_QST_05_5100_0900_00_chd,Please continue to assist with my research!
$CHADL_QST_06_4100_0100_00_chd,Cloud!
$CHADL_QST_06_4100_0200_00_chd,Thank you for securing the Ancient Materia.
$CHADL_QST_06_4100_0300_00_chd,I've already obtained the scan data from the terminal and started the analysis.
$CHADL_QST_06_4100_0400_00_chd,"If you come across any more Ancient Materia, please collect it for me."
$CHADL_QST_06_4200_0100_00_chd,"Great, we're connected!"
$CHADL_QST_06_4200_0110_00_chd,"For a moment, your location was completely lost."
$CHADL_QST_06_4200_0200_00_chd,I was worried that something might have happened.
$CHADL_QST_06_4200_0300_00_cld,I'm fine. There's no problem.
$CHADL_QST_06_4200_0400_00_chd,That's a relief.
$CHADL_QST_06_4200_0500_00_chd,"Well then, please continue collecting the Ancient Matter."
$CHADL_QST_06_4300_0100_00_chd,We did it!
$CHADL_QST_06_4300_0110_00_chd,"Thanks to tracking you, Cloud, I was able to analyze the data immediately."
$CHADL_QST_06_4300_0200_00_chd,It turns out that the garden from earlier exists in a separate dimension.
$CHADL_QST_06_4300_0300_00_cld,This is too much for me to handle.
$CHADL_QST_06_4300_0400_00_chd,"Hehe, I detect Cloud's unease."
$CHADL_QST_06_4300_0500_00_chd,I'm more determined than ever to solve this mystery.
$CHADL_QST_06_4300_0600_00_chd,I hope you'll continue to assist with the investigation!
$CHADL_QST_06_4400_0100_00_chd,Cloud! After analyzing the Ancient Materia...
$CHADL_QST_06_4400_0200_00_chd,I've determined that it's an armament made of an unknown substance not present in this world.
$CHADL_QST_06_4400_0300_00_chd,"Oh, I can feel my heart racing!"
$CHADL_QST_06_4400_0400_00_chd,"To further my research, please continue gathering Ancient Materia!"
$CHADL_QST_06_4500_0100_00_chd,"Congratulations on obtaining the Ancient materia, Cloud!"
$CHADL_QST_06_4500_0200_00_chd,"At this pace, please continue searching for the other Ancient materia."
$CHADL_QST_06_4500_0300_00_cld,"Yeah, we need to find it... quickly."
$CHADL_QST_06_5500_0100_00_chd,"Congratulations, Cloud, on obtaining the Ancient Materia!"
$CHADL_QST_06_5500_0200_00_chd,"Now that we have five, the analysis is progressing smoothly."
$CHADL_QST_06_5500_0300_00_chd,"However, we never know when that noisy individual might interfere again."
$CHADL_QST_06_5500_0400_00_chd,Let's stay vigilant until the end.
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_0100_00_gil,"Now, behold! Prepare to be awed by my swordsmanship!"
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_0200_00_gil,How impudent!
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_0300_00_gil,"Hmm, is this sensation perhaps the legendary holy sword, Excalibur!?"
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_0350_00_gil,You shall become rust on the holy sword!
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_0400_00_gil,"Oh, I have long awaited this moment, my holy sword!"
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_0500_00_gil,"Kahaha, well done!"
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_0510_00_gil,"In honor of your efforts, I shall show you the essence of a master swordsman!"
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_0600_00_gil,"How delightful, hahahaha!"
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_0700_00_gil,"Hah...hah... With this, victory is as good as mine!"
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_0800_00_gil,Do you wish to see the secret techniques of a martial arts master?
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_0900_00_gil,"Now, shall we turn reality into a dream?"
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_1000_00_gil,I shall lead you to the world of illusions.
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_1100_00_gil,Looks like it's time for the final act.
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_1200_00_gil,Darn it!
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_1300_00_gil,Impossible!
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_1400_00_gil,How could I...
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_1700_00_gil,Forget about that!
$COMMN_BOS_50_1100_1900_00_gil,Gilgamesh
$MOGLE_QST_01_0100_0100_00_cld,Where am I...?
$MOGLE_QST_01_0100_0200_00_mog,"Welcome to the Moogle Shop, kupo!"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0100_0210_00_mog,"But sorry, kupo. We're not open yet, kupo~"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0100_0300_00_lmg,Kupo kupo~!
$MOGLE_QST_01_0100_0400_00_mog,"Those little ones haven't come back, so we can't open the shop, kupo~"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0100_0500_00_mog,"So, I've got a favor to ask, kupo."
$MOGLE_QST_01_0100_0600_00_mog,"Please bring back the kids who are out playing to this Moogle House, kupo."
$MOGLE_QST_01_0100_0700_00_mog,"If you do that, we can open the Moogle Shop, kupo."
$MOGLE_QST_01_0100_0800_00_cld,"Alright, I'll help."
$MOGLE_QST_01_0100_0900_00_mog,"Thank you, kupo!"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0200_0100_00_mog,"Please bring my kids back, kupo!"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0200_0200_00_mog,"Could you gather up the kids for me, kupo?"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0200_0300_00_mog,"The kids are playing, so I can't open the shop, kupo."
$MOGLE_QST_01_0200_0700_00_mog,"I'll have to ask another time, kupo~"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0200_0800_00_mog,"I really want to open the shop soon, kupo~"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0200_0900_00_mog,"Those kids are such a handful, kupo~"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0300_0100_00_mog,"Heading back already, kupo?"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0300_0200_00_mog,"Giving up, kupo?"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0300_0300_00_mog,"Quitting, kupo?"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0400_0100_00_mog,"My mooglets are tough cookies, kupo. Best of luck!"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0400_0200_00_mog,"Please take care of the children, kupo!"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0400_0300_00_mog,"They're all little pranksters, so be careful, kupo!"
$MOGLE_QST_01_0500_0100_00_lmg,Kupo!
$MOGLE_QST_01_0500_0300_00_lmg,Over here!
$MOGLE_QST_01_0500_0400_00_lmg,So slow!

$PHOTO_QST_00_0500_0200_00_fcs,"You have an excellent eye for selecting shooting spots, and the Photo Club recognizes that."
$PHOTO_QST_00_0500_0300_00_fcs,Looks like I can't slack off either. Let's improve together.
$PHOTO_QST_00_0600_0100_00_fcs,Congratulations! You've been recognized as an 'Emerging Photographer'.
$PHOTO_QST_00_0600_0200_00_fcs,Your extraordinary sense has been a hot topic in the Photo Club.
$PHOTO_QST_00_0600_0300_00_fcs,"From now on, continue creating unique works as an artist."
$PHOTO_QST_00_0700_0100_00_fcs,Something great has happened! It seems you've finally been recognized as a 'visionary photographer'.
$PHOTO_QST_00_0700_0200_00_fcs,You should definitely hold a solo exhibition someday.
$PHOTO_QST_00_0700_0300_00_fcs,I can already imagine your works being displayed around the world.
$PHOTO_QST_00_0700_0400_00_fcs,I truly hope many people get to see them.
$PHOTO_QST_00_0800_0100_00_fcs,"Well, you've come a long way..."
$PHOTO_QST_00_0800_0200_00_fcs,Congratulations. You have become the 'Master of Photography'.
$PHOTO_QST_00_0800_0300_00_fcs,"Not just within the Photo Club, but you'll be remembered as an extraordinary photographer worldwide."
$PHOTO_QST_00_0800_0400_00_fcs,"From the first time we met, I knew you weren't an ordinary person."
$PHOTO_QST_00_0800_0500_00_fcs,But I never imagined you'd rise to such heights.
$PHOTO_QST_00_0800_0600_00_fcs,It's been an incredibly inspiring experience. Thank you so much.
$PHOTO_QST_00_0800_0700_00_fcs,"If you don't mind, I'd like you to have this."
$PHOTO_QST_00_0800_0710_00_fcs,I made it in commemoration of our meeting.
$PHOTO_QST_00_0800_0800_00_fcs,Please continue to share your wonderful works with the world.
$PHOTO_QST_00_0900_0100_00_fcs,Thank you for showing me so many great photography spots.
$PHOTO_QST_00_0900_0200_00_fcs,I hope your work will be recognized worldwide.
$PHOTO_QST_01_0100_0100_00_fcs,This overwhelming embrace... Such a beautiful wall.
$PHOTO_QST_01_0100_0200_00_fcs,"Not only does it prevent monsters from entering, but it also succeeds in bringing the town together."
$PHOTO_QST_01_0100_0300_00_fcs,You can see the artisan's quirks in the details. That charm is wonderful.
$PHOTO_QST_01_0200_0100_00_fcs,We meet again. Let's take a commemorative photo with the wall as the background.
$PHOTO_QST_01_0300_0100_00_fcs,Have you had a chance to look around Kalm's outer wall?
$PHOTO_QST_01_0300_0200_00_fcs,"The town's complex history is engraved here, and I can't stop taking pictures."
$PHOTO_QST_01_0300_0210_00_fcs,"If you find any other great photo spots, please let me know."
$PHOTO_QST_01_0300_0300_00_fcs,Capturing a flat surface like the wall with a camera is surprisingly tricky.
$PHOTO_QST_01_0300_0400_00_fcs,You need to be creative with angles and composition. It's quite the challenge.
$PHOTO_QST_01_0300_0500_00_fcs,"If you find any other picturesque landscapes, please let me know."
$PHOTO_QST_01_0400_0100_00_fcs,You've found a great spot for photos. Thank you.
$PHOTO_QST_01_0400_0200_00_fcs,The wall looks so lively today.
$PHOTO_QST_01_0400_0300_00_fcs,Did you know? Even walls have expressions.
$PHOTO_QST_01_0400_0310_00_fcs,I particularly recommend seeing it on rainy days.
$PHOTO_QST_01_0400_0400_00_fcs,"It has a melancholic feel, as if it's weeping for the sadness and futility of the battles it witnessed while protecting the town."
$PHOTO_QST_01_0400_0500_00_fcs,I can't help but get a little teary-eyed myself as I press the shutter.
$PHOTO_QST_01_0500_0100_00_fcs,"Kalm has many tall towers, so it could be interesting to take shots from a high angle."
$PHOTO_QST_01_0500_0200_00_fcs,"Capturing Midgar's nightscape from the top of a tower with a telephoto lens would be wonderful, wouldn't it?"
$PHOTO_QST_02_0100_0100_00_fcs,Old houses weathered by the sea breeze—it’s like the whole town has been aged to perfection.
$PHOTO_QST_02_0100_0200_00_fcs,"Maybe it’s because the fortress city Junon looms above, but the way the light filters through is exquisite."
$PHOTO_QST_02_0100_0300_00_fcs,"Giant pillars, old houses, dried fish—this contrast is unlike anything else."
$PHOTO_QST_02_0200_0100_00_fcs,"Oh, we meet again. How about a commemorative photo with the fortress city in the background?"
$PHOTO_QST_02_0300_0100_00_fcs,"Under Junon is quite fascinating, isn't it? Especially the eerily beautiful color of the sea."
$PHOTO_QST_02_0300_0200_00_fcs,Could it be due to the underwater Mako reactor? It seems worth capturing in a photo.
$PHOTO_QST_02_0300_0300_00_fcs,"If you find any other interesting subjects worth photographing, please let me know."
$PHOTO_QST_02_0300_0400_00_fcs,"Since the sky here is covered, adjusting the exposure is tricky."
$PHOTO_QST_02_0300_0500_00_fcs,It's a true test of a photographer's skill.
$PHOTO_QST_02_0300_0600_00_fcs,"If you come across any good shooting spots, please make sure to tell me."
$PHOTO_QST_02_0400_0100_00_fcs,"Oh, you found a great spot for photos. Thank you very much."
$PHOTO_QST_02_0400_0200_00_fcs,"This town might seem run-down at first glance, but the people’s faces are full of life."
$PHOTO_QST_02_0400_0300_00_fcs,"No, perhaps 'anger' would be a better word for it."
$PHOTO_QST_02_0400_0400_00_fcs,"Someday, I’d like to photograph the capital of the Junon Republic that sank into the sea due to the war."
$PHOTO_QST_02_0500_0100_00_fcs,"Junon Fortress City is quite fascinating as well. Each level has its own unique characteristics, so there's always something new to see."
$PHOTO_QST_02_0500_0200_00_fcs,"I want to take a photo of Junon's cannon from the sea. At this point, I might need to charter a small boat."
$PHOTO_QST_03_0100_0100_00_fcs,This inn has a certain charm. It feels steeped in history.
$PHOTO_QST_03_0100_0200_00_fcs,Could it be a remnant from when Costa del Sol was just a quaint fishing village?
$PHOTO_QST_03_0100_0300_00_fcs,"The tired walls, the disheveled roof, the sagging pillars..."
$PHOTO_QST_03_0100_0310_00_fcs,It's like it's decaying and returning to nature.
$PHOTO_QST_03_0100_0400_00_fcs,Watching the sea from such a distance... maybe it's shy?
$PHOTO_QST_03_0100_0500_00_fcs,"It looks so different now, almost unrecognizable."
$PHOTO_QST_03_0100_0600_00_fcs,"The old inn had its charm, but if I'm staying, it'll definitely be here."
$PHOTO_QST_03_0100_0700_00_fcs,I should also capture some shots of the unique and rare items in the owner's collection.
$PHOTO_QST_03_0200_0100_00_fcs,Costa~! We meet again.<br>Let's take a photo to commemorate this sunny day.
$PHOTO_QST_03_0300_0100_00_fcs,Did you happen to notice this inn too? You've got an eye for these things.
$PHOTO_QST_03_0300_0200_00_fcs,"Rather than glamorous five-star hotels, these hidden gem inns make for better pictures."
$PHOTO_QST_03_0300_0300_00_fcs,"If you find any other hidden photogenic spots, please let me know."
$PHOTO_QST_03_0300_0400_00_fcs,"Costa del Sol is just dazzling, isn't it?"
$PHOTO_QST_03_0300_0500_00_fcs,The sunlit beaches and the sea.
$PHOTO_QST_03_0300_0510_00_fcs,"The vibrant dancers full of charm, and the tropical cuisine."
$PHOTO_QST_03_0300_0600_00_fcs,Everything is so colorful and photogenic.
$PHOTO_QST_03_0300_0700_00_fcs,"If you come across any other great photography spots, do let me know."
$PHOTO_QST_03_0400_0100_00_fcs,You've found a great spot for taking photos. Thank you very much.
$PHOTO_QST_03_0400_0200_00_fcs,"Costa del Sol is a charming town, but you need to be careful when taking pictures."
$PHOTO_QST_03_0400_0300_00_fcs,"If you just casually choose a subject and press the shutter, all the photos will end up looking the same."
$PHOTO_QST_03_0400_0400_00_fcs,That's why I explore remote areas to find hidden spots.
$PHOTO_QST_03_0400_0500_00_fcs,Though sometimes I end up getting lost.
$PHOTO_QST_03_0500_0100_00_fcs,It might be interesting to try capturing some underwater shots.
$PHOTO_QST_03_0500_0200_00_fcs,The marine life unique to Costa is quite popular among the members of the Photo Club.
$PHOTO_QST_03_0500_0300_00_fcs,They ask me to shoot the new swimsuit line every year. I wonder what designs they came up with this time.
$PHOTO_QST_04_0100_00_fcs,Those rugged forms... Decadent and avant-garde. You could even call them revolutionary.
$PHOTO_QST_04_0100_0200_00_fcs,"They directly express the raw, wild spirit of the Greed gang."
$PHOTO_QST_04_0100_0300_00_fcs,Magnificent.
$PHOTO_QST_04_0100_0400_00_fcs,The sense of unity between these bikes and their riders... It's like they're twins.
$PHOTO_QST_04_0200_0100_00_fcs,We meet again. How about a picture to remember this moment in Corel Prison?
$PHOTO_QST_04_0300_0100_00_fcs,The people in the Under Saucer are extremely captivating subjects.
$PHOTO_QST_04_0300_0200_00_fcs,"Their raw desires are on full display, and I never get tired of watching them."
$PHOTO_QST_04_0300_0210_00_fcs,Leave photographing the people to me.
$PHOTO_QST_04_0300_0300_00_fcs,"If you find any interesting spots to shoot around here, please let me know."
$PHOTO_QST_04_0300_0400_00_fcs,"I've been attacked by Greed a few times, but I kept snapping shots while running away."
$PHOTO_QST_04_0300_0500_00_fcs,The photos should have a real sense of urgency!
$PHOTO_QST_04_0300_0600_00_fcs,"The shoot at Corel Prison is going smoothly, so please help me find more shooting spots."
$PHOTO_QST_04_0400_0100_00_fcs,Thank you for finding a great spot for photos. I appreciate it.
$PHOTO_QST_04_0400_0200_00_fcs,The Gold Saucer and the Under Saucer are truly like light and shadow.
$PHOTO_QST_04_0400_0300_00_fcs,Violence and crime swirl beneath the glittering theme park.
$PHOTO_QST_04_0400_0400_00_fcs,"By juxtaposing these in photos, I believe we can vividly capture human desires."
$PHOTO_QST_04_0400_0500_00_fcs,"It sounds like an interesting concept, doesn't it?"
$PHOTO_QST_04_0500_0100_00_fcs,This place is unpredictable. I have to stay on my toes.
$PHOTO_QST_04_0500_0110_00_fcs,Can't afford to miss a shot.
$PHOTO_QST_04_0500_0200_00_fcs,I keep my camera with me even when I sleep to avoid theft.
$PHOTO_QST_05_0100_0100_00_fcs,"This is Gongaga's specialty, the Gongaga mushrooms."
$PHOTO_QST_05_0100_0110_00_fcs,I've never seen them raw before.
$PHOTO_QST_05_0100_0200_00_fcs,What a vibrant color.
$PHOTO_QST_05_0100_0210_00_fcs,Just looking at them through the lens makes my mouth water.
$PHOTO_QST_05_0100_0300_00_fcs,Capturing the deliciousness of these mushrooms in a photo will be a real test of skill.
$PHOTO_QST_05_0200_0100_00_fcs,"Nice to see you again! How about a commemorative photo, just as smooth as the Gongaga mushrooms?"
$PHOTO_QST_05_0300_0100_00_fcs,A restaurant has asked me to take some photos for their menu.
$PHOTO_QST_05_0300_0200_00_fcs,They want me to capture images of freshly picked Gongaga mushrooms.
$PHOTO_QST_05_0300_0300_00_fcs,"Since I'm here in Gongaga anyway, I'll also be taking some pictures of the landscape."
$PHOTO_QST_05_0300_0400_00_fcs,"If you know any good spots for photos, please let me know."
$PHOTO_QST_05_0300_0500_00_fcs,Time seems to move slower here. People and animals are more relaxed than in the city.
$PHOTO_QST_05_0300_0600_00_fcs,I want to capture that feeling in my photos.
$PHOTO_QST_05_0300_0700_00_fcs,"If you find any perfect photo spots, please let me know."
$PHOTO_QST_05_0400_0100_00_fcs,"Hey, you found a great spot for taking pictures. Thanks a lot!"
$PHOTO_QST_05_0400_0200_00_fcs,There are a few tricks to photographing plants.
$PHOTO_QST_05_0400_0210_00_fcs,The key is to lower your viewpoint.
$PHOTO_QST_05_0400_0300_00_fcs,"By aligning with the height of the plants, you can create an immersive feeling, like you're lost in the forest."
$PHOTO_QST_05_0400_0400_00_fcs,"Think about the contrast with the background, lower your posture, and get up close - just like this!"
$PHOTO_QST_05_0400_0500_00_fcs,You should definitely give it a try.
$PHOTO_QST_05_0500_0100_00_fcs,"If I take good pictures, I'm going to treat myself to a Gongaga dish."
$PHOTO_QST_05_0500_0200_00_fcs,"Ugh, I can't wait to eat Gongaga mushrooms. I'll channel these feelings into my photos."
$PHOTO_QST_06_0100_0100_00_fcs,What a beautiful and majestic land.
$PHOTO_QST_06_0100_0110_00_fcs,This is a masterpiece created by the planet.
$PHOTO_QST_06_0100_0200_00_fcs,"The way shadows fall on the expansive red earth, it's so dynamic yet so refined."
$PHOTO_QST_06_0100_0300_00_fcs,"The irregular yet exquisite balance, I can't stop pressing the shutter."
$PHOTO_QST_06_0200_0100_00_fcs,Fancy seeing you again. How about a photo of you praying to the planet?
$PHOTO_QST_06_0300_0100_00_fcs,"Looking out over the lands of Cosmo Canyon, I feel the limits of what a photo can capture."
$PHOTO_QST_06_0300_0200_00_fcs,This overwhelming feeling can't be fully appreciated without seeing it with your own eyes.
$PHOTO_QST_06_0300_0300_00_fcs,But that's exactly why it's worth the challenge.
$PHOTO_QST_06_0300_0400_00_fcs,"If you find any mystical photography spots, please let me know."
$PHOTO_QST_06_0300_0500_00_fcs,Cosmo Canyon is also famous for its stunning view of the starry night sky.
$PHOTO_QST_06_0300_0600_00_fcs,"Of course, I brought my night photography gear. I plan to stay up all night capturing the perfect star-lit shot."
$PHOTO_QST_06_0300_0700_00_fcs,"If you find any other good photo spots, please let me know."
$PHOTO_QST_06_0400_0100_00_fcs,You found a great place for photos. Thank you so much.
$PHOTO_QST_06_0400_0200_00_fcs,Capturing the land carved by the planet over eons with a camera...
$PHOTO_QST_06_0400_0300_00_fcs,"In that moment, it’s like my own will disappears, and I become one with the planet."
$PHOTO_QST_06_0400_0400_00_fcs,I often talk about this with other members of the photo club...
$PHOTO_QST_06_0400_0500_00_fcs,It feels like we’re not photographing the subject; the subject is making us take the photo.
$PHOTO_QST_06_0400_0600_00_fcs,And it's often this feeling that leads to the best works.
$PHOTO_QST_06_0500_0100_00_fcs,I'd love to use that astronomical telescope to take some photos one day.
$PHOTO_QST_06_0500_0200_00_fcs,I wonder if people in the past felt the same awe at these views as we do now.
$PHOTO_QST_07_0100_0100_00_fcs,That's Mt. Nibel...
$PHOTO_QST_07_0100_0110_00_fcs,"I'd heard rumors, but it has a truly unique shape."
$PHOTO_QST_07_0100_0200_00_fcs,"The sky, torn apart by its ominous ridges, almost looks like a fantastical painting."
$PHOTO_QST_07_0100_0300_00_fcs,Mt. Nibel behind the sanatorium... What a bizarre sight.
$PHOTO_QST_07_0200_0100_00_fcs,We meet again. How about a photo with your friends in black robes?
$PHOTO_QST_07_0300_0100_00_fcs,This seems to be a treatment facility run by the Shinra Company.
$PHOTO_QST_07_0300_0200_00_fcs,I applied and somehow got permission to take pictures.
$PHOTO_QST_07_0300_0300_00_fcs,"However... they said all the photos will be reviewed, and might be confiscated if necessary."
$PHOTO_QST_07_0300_0400_00_fcs,"Well, as long as we take good pictures, we should be fine."
$PHOTO_QST_07_0300_0500_00_fcs,"So, if you find any recommended photo spots, please let me know."
$PHOTO_QST_07_0300_0600_00_fcs,My goal is none other than Mt. Nibel.
$PHOTO_QST_07_0300_0700_00_fcs,Its unique and eerie shape is one of a kind. Just looking at it gives me chills.
$PHOTO_QST_07_0300_0800_00_fcs,"Since I've come all the way to Nibelheim, I plan to take various other shots as well."
$PHOTO_QST_07_0300_0900_00_fcs,"If you find any good photo spots, let me know."
$PHOTO_QST_07_0400_0100_00_fcs,You found a great spot for the photo shoot. Thank you very much.
$PHOTO_QST_07_0400_0200_00_fcs,This place is the site of the world's first Mako reactor. Why would Shinra turn it into a treatment center?
$PHOTO_QST_07_0400_0300_00_fcs,"It seems like it would be more profitable as a tourist spot. Plus, the buildings look unusually new, don't they?"
$PHOTO_QST_07_0400_0400_00_fcs,Could there be some big secret hidden here?
$PHOTO_QST_07_0400_0500_00_fcs,"Hehe, imagining the hidden stories behind the subjects is part of the fun of photography, isn't it?"
$PHOTO_QST_07_0500_0100_00_fcs,"There's a building nearby called the Shinra Mansion, but I couldn't get permission to photograph it."
$PHOTO_QST_07_0500_0200_00_fcs,I hope Shinra doesn't confiscate my photos.

$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_0100_00_chd,"Well then, please continue with the world report."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_0200_00_chd,"If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask me anytime."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_0300_00_chd,"So, please make sure to report your findings regularly."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_0400_00_chd,"I’m already excited thinking about where I’ll see you next, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_0500_00_chd,"We never know what might happen on a journey, so please be careful."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_0600_00_chd,I wish you luck and take care.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_0700_00_chd,"Um, Cloud, it seems there haven't been any world report updates lately."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_0800_00_chd,"I’m sure the best mercenary in the world wouldn’t forget a task, right?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_0900_00_chd,"I know you must be busy, but I’d appreciate your help."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_1000_00_chd,"By the way, Cloud..."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_1100_00_chd,Have you made any progress on the research into the Ancient Materia I asked about?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_1200_00_chd,"I'm not trying to rush you, but I've been eagerly waiting."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_1210_00_chd,"Please, do your best."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_1300_00_chd,"By the way, Cloud..."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_1400_00_chd,What about the rare monster identified during the Lifestream spot investigation?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_1410_00_chd,It's a chance to obtain valuable biological data.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0200_1500_00_chd,"It might be a tough opponent, but I ask you to be well-prepared and take on the challenge."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_0100_00_chd,That was a splendid job suppressing Titan! His legendary earth-shattering strength was truly awe-inspiring.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_0200_00_chd,The mighty giant will surely provide steadfast support for your journey.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_0300_00_chd,You've gained a reliable ally!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_0400_00_chd,That was an impressive victory over Phoenix!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_0500_00_chd,I was mesmerized by the enchanting flames summoned by the Phoenix.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_0600_00_chd,"With the immortal bird that reincarnates at your side, there's nothing to fear anymore!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_0700_00_chd,Congratulations on overcoming Alexander! It was impressive to see you withstand his strict judgment.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_0800_00_chd,"From now on, the holy fortress will protect you. Continue your journey with ease!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_0900_00_chd,Great job subduing Kujata!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_0910_00_chd,You skillfully tamed the mighty bull with multiple attributes.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_1000_00_chd,Feel free to ride this wild beast across the world!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_1100_00_chd,Congratulations on defeating Bahamut Arisen!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_1200_00_chd,I never imagined the evolved god of destruction could be surpassed. I feel like I've glimpsed beyond the limits.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_1300_00_chd,"With the crimson god of destruction at your side,"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_1400_00_chd,you should be able to break through any hardships that lie ahead!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_1500_00_chd,To think that you actually defeated Odin...
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_1600_00_chd,I couldn't even blink during such a high-stakes battle where one mistake meant certain death.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_1700_00_chd,"With his Zantetsuken, you'll cut through any obstacle in your path!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_1800_00_chd,"Cloud,"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_1810_00_chd,You've completed all the combat trials I prepared for you.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_1900_00_chd,"I knew you could pull it off, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_2000_00_chd,I'll make good use of the battle data we've collected from everyone.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_2100_00_chd,Those battles were truly intense. Well done!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_2200_00_chd,"Oh, and I'll keep the simulator available, so feel free to use it anytime."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_2300_00_chd,I've obtained excellent data. Thank you!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_2400_00_chd,What an elegant victory! Very impressive!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_2500_00_chd,Do you find the simulator too easy?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_2600_00_chd,I can see from your expression that you're as confident as ever!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_2700_00_chd,Your combat data is steadily increasing.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_2800_00_chd,Feel free to challenge it again anytime.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_2900_00_chd,The great thing about the simulator is that you can keep trying as many times as you want.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_3000_00_chd,Let's use this defeat to improve for the next time.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_3100_00_chd,Everyone has off days.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0300_3200_00_chd,"Rest assured, even data from failures is valuable to me."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0100_00_chd,"Cloud, sir"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0102_00_chd,"Cloud, sir"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0104_00_chd,"Cloud, sir"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0110_00_chd,"Thanks to you, I've gathered all the data for the world report. Your efforts are greatly appreciated."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0112_00_chd,"Thanks to you, I've gathered all the data for the world report. Your efforts are greatly appreciated."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0114_00_chd,"Thanks to you, I've gathered all the data for the world report. Your efforts are greatly appreciated."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0200_00_chd,"Actually, there’s something I'd like you to see, Cloud, sir."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0202_00_chd,"Actually, there’s something I'd like you to see, Cloud, sir."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0204_00_chd,"Actually, there’s something I'd like you to see, Cloud, sir."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0300_00_chd,Could you spare a moment to accompany me?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0300_05_chd,Yes
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0302_00_chd,"Could I trouble you for a moment, Cloud?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0304_00_chd,"Could I trouble you for a moment, Cloud?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0400_00_chd,"Please, have a look."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0500_00_cld,What's this...?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0600_00_chd,"This is the information we have gathered about this planet, thanks to your efforts."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0700_00_msg,"Wow, this is amazing!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0800_00_msg,"Cloud-sama, please look! Some of these monsters, I guided you to them."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_0900_00_msg,"That one, and that one too!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1000_00_msg,"Ah, so many wonderful memories. It really was an enjoyable journey, wasn't it?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1090_00_chd,MAI.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1100_00_chd,"I'm discussing something important right now, so please don't interrupt."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1200_00_msg,Okay.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1300_00_chd,The true purpose of the World Report was to archive data about the planet.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1400_00_chd,I call this archive the 'Ark Library.'
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1500_00_chd,"Currently, this planet is in a very complex situation."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1600_00_chd,"Shinra, mako, Avalanche."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1610_00_chd,"Wutai, the anti-Shinra coalition."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1620_00_chd,"The Weapons, Jenova."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1630_00_chd,And... Sephiroth.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1700_00_chd,No one can tell what lies ahead.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1800_00_chd,"One day, this planet itself could disappear."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1900_00_chd,That's why I wanted to leave something behind.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_1910_00_chd,"The lives of the people, the activities of life, and the essence of this planet..."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_2000_00_cld,The planet won't disappear. We won't let it.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_2100_00_chd,"Yes, of course. I believe in you, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_2200_00_chd,I'll also fight with you to preserve this beautiful planet.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_2300_00_chd,"From now on, as I continue my journey,"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_2400_00_chd,I'll advance various studies based on the vast amount of data collected.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_2500_00_chd,"Someday, I might request a new world report from somewhere else in the world."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0400_2600_00_chd,I look forward to working with you!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_0100_00_chd,"You've completed the world report. Thank you so much for your hard work, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_0200_00_chd,"Though the world report is complete, our collaboration isn't over yet, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_0300_00_chd,"Heh heh, feel free to call on me anytime."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_0400_00_chd,"You look well, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_0500_00_chd,"I've been traveling around, looking for a base where I can conduct thorough research."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_0510_00_chd,"Every town has its charm, making it hard to choose."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_0600_00_chd,"Thanks to the reports you gathered,"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_0610_00_chd,I've been able to gain a multifaceted view of the world.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_0700_00_chd,"The more I learn about this world, the more exciting the adventure becomes."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_0800_00_chd,"Cloud, how are your adventures going? Well, I hope?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_0900_00_chd,Hello! How are you doing?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_1000_00_chd,"Thanks to the data everyone gathered, my research is progressing smoothly. Thank you."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_1100_00_chd,Hmm... It would be nice to do some relaxing research in Kalm.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_1200_00_chd,"Though, I might end up too relaxed and not get any work done. What do you think, Cloud?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_1300_00_chd,It might be nice to conduct research surrounded by chocobos.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_1310_00_chd,Analyzing the cries of chocobos could be quite interesting.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_1400_00_chd,"Sniff, sniff..."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_1500_00_chd,The unique blend of chocobo scent and sea breeze is truly special here.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_1510_00_chd,I think conducting research surrounded by this fragrance would be nice.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_1600_00_chd,"While I'm in this town, I plan to advance my research on the ocean."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_1700_00_chd,I intend to conduct my own research so dolphins can live safely.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_1800_00_chd,"Are you taking a break at the resort too, Cloud? I'm currently considering trying out sunbathing."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_1900_00_chd,"Hmm, maybe it would be good to study coal once again."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_2000_00_chd,I think having resources other than mako would be beneficial.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_2100_00_chd,"The Gold Saucer isn't suitable for research. There are too many distractions, and it makes me anxious."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_2200_00_chd,It might be good to do some desert research here.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_2300_00_chd,"When the time comes, I'd like to ask for your services as a bodyguard, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_2400_00_chd,"It's nice to conduct research in this quiet village, and there's plenty of Gongaga mushrooms."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_2500_00_chd,I'm thinking about flying with a sky chocobo next time.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_2600_00_chd,"When that happens, Cloud, I'd appreciate if you could teach me the ropes."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_2700_00_chd,"Planetology is immensely interesting, but I feel an update is necessary."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_2800_00_chd,"So, I plan to carry on what I've learned here in my own way."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_2900_00_chd,Phew... Learning from the Chocobo Sage requires a lot of patience.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_3000_00_chd,This village gives off a feeling of Professor Hojo's presence.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_3100_00_chd,"To surpass Professor Hojo, it might be good to conduct research here."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_3200_00_chd,"Well then, I wish you safe travels. Take care."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_3300_00_chd,"Though the world report is complete, please visit me anytime."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_3400_00_chd,Completing the world report has made me feel even more curious.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0500_3500_00_chd,I hope to visit other continents someday.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_0100_00_chd,"Cloud, there should be a 'Craft Chip' buried around here."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_0200_00_chd,Try using a chocobo's sense of smell to search the area.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_0300_00_chd,"Once you find a suspicious spot, have it dig it up with its beak."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_0400_00_chd,"Well then, let the treasure hunt begin!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_0500_00_chd,Cloud.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_0600_00_chd,"If you're looking for a Craft Chip, why not call a chocobo?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_0700_00_chd,Cloud.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_0800_00_chd,"If you can't find the location of the Craft Chip, try using the chocobo's sense of smell."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_0900_00_chd,"Cloud, you've discovered a Lifespring!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_1000_00_chd,"Quickly, try using the terminal to investigate it."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_1100_00_chd,"By accessing the planet's knowledge, we should be able to obtain information about this area."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_1200_00_chd,I've received data about the life spot.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_1300_00_chd,These kinds of Lifestream fountains are scattered all over.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_1400_00_chd,"Because they are too small to be converted into energy, Shinra ignores them."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_1500_00_chd,"But for us, they are valuable sources of information."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_1510_00_chd,Please continue searching for more life spots.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_2300_00_chd,"Cloud, do you see any beautiful minerals around here?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_2400_00_chd,These are called 'guidestones' and are said to lead travelers to the shrines of summons.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_2500_00_chd,"Guidestones emit a guiding light when destroyed. If you find one, please try breaking it."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_2600_00_chd,Following the light from the guidestones will likely lead you to the 'Summoning Shrines' talked about in various regions.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_2700_00_chd,"Within them lie massive crystals, containing crystallized knowledge of summon creatures."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_2800_00_chd,"To enhance your summon materia, please discover the shrines and analyze the crystals!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_2900_00_chd,"Cloud, there should be a shrine for summon creatures nearby."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_2910_00_chd,"If you find a guidestone, try breaking it."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_3000_00_chd,"Cloud, I've detected the energy waves of a summon creature. Please prepare for crystal analysis."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_3100_00_chd,"High energy readings up ahead. Cloud, there should be a shrine for summon creatures."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_3200_00_chd,"I've detected peculiar echoes. Cloud, please search for the shrine of summon creatures."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_3300_00_chd,"Detected crystal frequencies. Cloud, this is your chance to gain knowledge about summon creatures!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_3400_00_chd,"Cloud, do you see a guidestone nearby? Let's have it lead us to the shrine of summon creatures."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_3500_00_chd,"Incredible, Cloud! This is the first time I've seen such a huge crystal."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_3600_00_chd,Inside this crystal lies the knowledge of the summon beasts... Let’s start the analysis immediately.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_3700_00_chd,"To extract data on the summon beast, you’ll need to synchronize with the crystal."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_3800_00_chd,Good luck!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_3900_00_chd,Analysis complete! Data on the summon beast has been extracted from the crystal.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_4000_00_chd,This will allow us to enhance your summon materia.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_4300_00_chd,I successfully extracted the data on the summon beast. Thank you!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_4400_00_chd,It went smoothly! Please continue with the other crystals.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_4500_00_chd,"It was perfect. Thanks to you, we have gained summon beast knowledge."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_4600_00_chd,Splendid synchronization! Please continue investigating the other shrines.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_4700_00_chd,"It was as if you were conversing with the crystal, Cloud. Well done."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_4800_00_chd,"This is quite challenging, isn't it?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_4900_00_chd,It seems the crystal has rejected you.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_5000_00_chd,"I'm sure you can do better, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_5100_00_chd,"Next time, try to stay calm and observe the crystal's pattern."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_5200_00_chd,"Cloud, with a mountain chocobo, you should be able to climb this cliff."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_5300_00_chd,Cloud.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_5310_00_chd,"To proceed further, you'll need the strong legs of a mountain chocobo."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_5400_00_chd,"Cloud, I've heard that forest chocobos use mushrooms to jump."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_5500_00_chd,"Cloud, a forest chocobo can help you slide across the vines."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_5600_00_chd,"Cloud, perhaps a sky chocobo could help you cross beyond here."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_5700_00_chd,"Cloud, a sky chocobo should be able to catch an updraft and fly."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_5800_00_chd,"Cloud, to proceed from here, you'll need the power of an ocean chocobo."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_5900_00_chd,"Cloud, an ocean chocobo can utilize the power of water to fly."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_6000_00_chd,"Cloud, you'll need a buggy to go further from here."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_6100_00_chd,"Cloud, you can only cross quicksand with a buggy."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_6200_00_chd,"Cloud, please be careful."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_6300_00_chd,This is an island that appeared suddenly during our investigation of the Ancient Materia.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_6310_00_chd,We've named it 'Gilgamesh Island.'
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_6400_00_chd,We have no idea what awaits beyond here.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_6500_00_chd,MAI... MAI! Please wake up.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_6600_00_msg,Hawww... What's going on? I was having such a nice sleep mode.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_6700_00_msg,Wait─where are we?!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_6800_00_chd,Please check the surrounding area for monster data immediately.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_6900_00_msg,"Yes, understood."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_7000_00_msg,No data... Unable to provide guidance!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_7100_00_chd,"I see, this makes it even more intriguing."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_7200_00_chd,"Ahead of this island, I'm detecting signals from all the Ancient Matter we've found up to now."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_7300_00_chd,"Cloud, our quest for Ancient Matter is nearing its end."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0100_7400_00_chd,Remain diligent and proceed.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_0100_00_chd,"Cloud, after advancing our investigation into the Life Spot..."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_0200_00_chd,"We've identified the nest of the rare bird Quetzalcoatl, which inhabits the grasslands."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_0300_00_chd,It's a rare species that seldom appears before people. I'd like you to gather some biological data!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_0400_00_chd,"Additionally, we can obtain materials required to make 'Windmill Gears' from it."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_0500_00_chd,Mildred in Windmill Village is waiting. Please complete the subjugation as soon as possible.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_0600_00_chd,"Cloud, by examining the Lifestream..."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_0700_00_chd,I discovered the location where Republic-era craft chips are buried.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_0900_00_chd,There might be valuable recipes there that cannot be found nowadays.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_1000_00_chd,Please search the area.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_1100_00_chd,Cloud!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_1110_00_chd,"After analyzing the data obtained from the Life Spot, I've discovered a new craft chip."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_1200_00_chd,It appears to be lying dormant in the disposal site for mako pipes.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_1300_00_chd,Why don’t you head over there with a chocobo and enjoy the grasslands scenery on the way?
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_1400_00_chd,Well done on defeating the monsters.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_1500_00_msg,Good job!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_1600_00_chd,Based on the recent battle data...
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_1700_00_chd,I have generated a new combat course in the battle simulator.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_1800_00_msg,I assisted as well.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_1900_00_chd,Feel free to try it out when you have a chance.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_2000_00_msg,Please do!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_2100_00_chd,Cloud-san─
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_2200_00_msg,"Lord Cloud, congratulations on completing the mission!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_2300_00_chd,Please don't interrupt.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_2400_00_msg,Whatever could you be talking about?
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_2500_00_chd,"Once again, Cloud-san..."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_2600_00_chd,I've analyzed the combat data you provided and created a new combat course.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_2610_00_chd,I hope you'll give it a try if you are interested.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_2700_00_msg,"Bravo, that was a magnificent battle!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_2800_00_msg,The data from Lord Cloud's splendid performance...
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_2810_00_msg,"Master has created a new combat course, so please give it a try!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_2900_00_chd,Wha─!? It seems MAI has already explained everything. I have nothing more to add.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_3000_00_chd,It seems there is a shrine to Titan in the grasslands.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_3100_00_chd,"In the age of myth, when Titan awoke from his subterranean prison, a massive earthquake ensued."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_3300_00_chd,It is said the land that rose from the sea due to that earthquake became the grasslands.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_3400_00_chd,"According to the legends passed down in the grasslands, Titan's might was extraordinary."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_3500_00_chd,He could close fissures with his hands and shatter mountains with his fists.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_3600_00_chd,Perhaps it is thanks to Titan that the beautiful plains of the grasslands exist.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_3700_00_chd,The people of the grasslands believed that earthquakes would occur if Titan were angered.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_3800_00_chd,It seems that Kalm's current harvest festival originally began as an offering of crops to Titan.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_4000_00_chd,"With this, we have analyzed all the crystals in the grasslands. Well done."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_4100_00_chd,"With this, Titan will become even stronger. It's reassuring, isn't it?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_4200_00_chd,"But Mr. Cloud, you still don't have a summon materia, do you?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0200_4300_00_chd,"First, please try challenging the summon in the battle simulator!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_0100_00_chd,Mr. Cloud.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_0110_00_chd,"Analyzing the data, we've discovered a fiend called 'Mindflayer' lurking in Junon."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_0200_00_chd,This terrifying creature is said to drain the brains of humans.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_0300_00_chd,Please eliminate it as soon as possible!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_0400_00_chd,"Mr. Cloud, congratulations on defeating the Mindflayer!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_0500_00_chd,"I was anxious it might drain your brain, but my worries were unfounded."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_0600_00_msg,"Defeating such a fiend makes you a true hero, Mr. Cloud!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_0700_00_msg,"Thanks to you, the world is now a bit more peaceful. Thank you, hero!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_0800_00_chd,"Thank you, hero!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_0900_00_chd,"Mr. Cloud, after investigating the Lifestream..."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_1000_00_chd,I've pinpointed the location of a republic-era craft chip.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_1100_00_chd,It seems to be resting with the remnants of the Junon republic near the coast.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_1200_00_chd,This area is pocked with craters from intense shelling during the war.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_1300_00_chd,Be careful with your footing as you proceed.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_1400_00_chd,"Great job, Cloud. How was that battle?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_1500_00_chd,"Hehe, my sensors detected your dissatisfaction."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_1600_00_msg,I noticed it too! Detected it!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_1700_00_chd,"MAI, you don't have that functionality."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_1800_00_chd,"Cloud, using the data from your recent battle, I've created a new combat course."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_1810_00_chd,Please give it a try if you like.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_1900_00_msg,"Master Cloud, you have completed all the Junon assignments!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_2000_00_msg,"Oh my, is something wrong? You seem a little tired."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_2010_00_msg,Would you like me to give you a shoulder massage?
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_2100_00_chd,And how do you intend to do that?
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_2200_00_msg,"I have my beautiful voice. See, like this, with vibrations~"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_2300_00_chd,"Hahaha... Alright, let's leave the jokes aside."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_2400_00_chd,"I've created a new combat course, so please give it a try sometime."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_2500_00_chd,Junon is home to the Summon Shrine of Phoenix.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_2600_00_chd,"Ifrit is widely known as the fire summon, but Phoenix is equally powerful."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_2700_00_chd,"Unlike Ifrit's flames that incinerate enemies, Phoenix's fire is said to be rejuvenating."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_2800_00_chd,I bet it's a gentle flame.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_2900_00_chd,There are legends passed down in Junon.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_3000_00_chd,"One day, when a Phoenix was nearing the end of its life, it landed on the shores of Junon."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_3100_00_chd,"At that moment, a fisherman who was warming himself by a bonfire was there."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_3200_00_chd,"The Phoenix received some of that fire and wrapped itself in the flames, beautifully reviving itself."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_3300_00_chd,"According to the legends from around here, the Phoenix that revived in Junon"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_3400_00_chd,created various fish from the flames as a token of thanks and released them into the sea.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_3500_00_chd,"So Cloud, when you eat fish in Junon, remember to thank the Phoenix."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_3600_00_chd,"With this, all the crystals in Junon have been analyzed. Good job."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_3700_00_chd,The Phoenix may become even more beautiful. I look forward to it.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_3800_00_chd,"But Cloud, you still don't have any summon materia, do you?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0300_3900_00_chd,"First, try challenging a summon in the battle simulator!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_0100_00_chd,Cloud-san
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_0110_00_chd,I've discovered the location of the king who reigns over all tonberries—the Tonberry King!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_0200_00_chd,This is our chance to uncover the mysteries of this enigmatic creature.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_0300_00_chd,"According to rumors, he wears a beautiful crown. Perhaps you could seize an opportunity to steal it."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_0400_00_msg,"Well done, Cloud-sama! Now you are the true king!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_0500_00_chd,"By studying the biometric data of the Tonberry King, we might understand the social structures of tonberries."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_0600_00_chd,"This advancement in our research is invaluable. Thank you, Cloud-san!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_0700_00_chd,"Cloud-san, after examining the Lifestream data,"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_0800_00_chd,I have pinpointed the location of a craft chip from the era of the Republic.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_0900_00_chd,It appears it was once inside a valve factory.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_1000_00_chd,"After the republic fell to Shinra, it was abandoned and has become a ruin."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_1100_00_chd,"Exploring ruins… It's quite thrilling, isn't it?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_1200_00_chd,"Mr. Cloud,"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_1210_00_chd,"After analyzing the information from the lifespring, I discovered a new crafting chip."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_1300_00_chd,It seems to be sleeping in an abandoned village lost to desertification.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_1400_00_chd,"If left alone, the desertification will worsen, and the entire village could be swallowed by the sands."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_1500_00_chd,Please retrieve the chip before that happens.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_1600_00_chd,Great job taking care of the monsters.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_1700_00_chd,"Based on the combat data, I've added a new combat course to the battle simulator."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_1800_00_msg,Which I also supervised!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_1900_00_chd,I believe I've created something quite interesting. Please give it a try.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_2000_00_msg,"Cloud, according to my assessment, your performance in this mission... is a perfect score!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_2100_00_chd,"Oh, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_2200_00_chd,"Don't pay any attention to MAI, she's just making things up."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_2300_00_msg,"You, on the other hand, get a three out of ten."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_2400_00_chd,W-What!? I demand to know the criteria for this evaluation!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_2410_00_chd,But this is no time to be talking about that.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_2500_00_chd,I've devised a new combat course. Please try it out.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_2600_00_chd,"Well done, Cloud. With this, the Corel extermination request is complete."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_2700_00_msg,"Looking back, there were so many different monsters!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_2800_00_msg,"Shoalopods, Needle Kisses, land worms, chimeras─"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_2900_00_chd,"Alright, that's enough."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_3000_00_chd,"Cloud, I've added a new combat course to the simulator."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_3100_00_chd,Please try it out sometime.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_3200_00_chd,Cloud.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_3300_00_chd,"It's been a while since our last investigation, so let me explain the situation again."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_3400_00_chd,"To unseal the modular reactors, you need to find the 'Cactuar Rock'."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_3500_00_chd,Try holding it up where you see a cactuar statue. The light should lead you to the Cactuar Rock.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_3600_00_chd,"To obtain the Ancient Materia, you must clear the Cactuar Trial."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_3700_00_chd,Kid G is waiting for you inside the modular reactor. Good luck!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_3800_00_chd,There’s a shrine in Corel that holds the knowledge of the summon Alexander.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_3900_00_chd,"Long ago, a great nation in Corel that prospered through wicked deeds"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_4000_00_chd,"was destroyed overnight by a giant mechanical entity, according to legend."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_4010_00_chd,That entity is said to be Alexander.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_4100_00_chd,"According to Corel's legends, Alexander"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_4200_00_chd,appears from nowhere to pass judgment whenever people stray from the right path.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_4210_00_chd,No one can escape his holy judgment.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_4300_00_chd,"In Corel, they scare misbehaving children by saying Alexander will come for them."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_4400_00_chd,"Cloud, just between you and me..."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_4410_00_chd,I actually really like Alexander.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_4500_00_chd,It's a giant robot after all. It's amazing!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_4600_00_chd,"I wanted to meet Alexander so much, I even considered doing something bad just to see him."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_4700_00_chd,So I can't wait to see what kind of knowledge I'll gain next!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_4800_00_chd,"With this, we've analyzed all the crystals in Corel. Great job!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_4900_00_chd,I'm so overwhelmed with the knowledge I gained about Alexander. Thank you so much!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_5000_00_chd,"But, Cloud, you haven't obtained that summon materia yet, have you?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0400_5100_00_chd,"First, try challenging the summon in the battle simulator!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_0100_00_chd,"Cloud, I've obtained new monster information from a life spot."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_0200_00_chd,"Deep in the forest, there's a giant Morbol... Pardon me."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_0210_00_chd,It seems there is a giant 'Morbol' residing deep in the forest.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_0300_00_chd,It might be affecting the ecosystem. I urge you to investigate and exterminate it promptly.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_0400_00_chd,"Also, regarding Kyrie's request..."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_0500_00_chd,You might obtain the materials needed to create the 'Legendary Bait' as well.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_0600_00_chd,Please take care of the monsters rampaging in Costa's sea too.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_0700_00_msg,"Master Cloud, that was a great victory!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_0800_00_msg,You have admirably returned the monster born from the forest's richness back to the woods!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_0900_00_chd,The material you obtained now is very rare. It might be useful for crafting someday.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_1000_00_chd,Please hold on to this carefully.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_1100_00_chd,"With this, we can craft the 'Legendary Bait' that Kyrie requested."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_1200_00_chd,This bait should lure the monsters troubling Costa's seas.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_1300_00_chd,"When you have a moment, please head to the restricted area of Costa."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_1400_00_chd,You've obtained one of the materials needed for Kyrie's 'Legendary Bait'.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_1500_00_chd,Let's quickly gather the remaining materials to defeat the monsters ravaging the sea.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_1600_00_chd,"Cloud, according to my analysis of the Lifestream..."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_1700_00_chd,I've located where a Republic-era craft chip is buried.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_1800_00_chd,I've detected a signal from the canyon near the reactor.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_1900_00_chd,"The area seems to be littered with debris from the construction of the Gongaga Reactor, so be careful."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_1910_00_chd,Please be careful.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_2000_00_chd,Mr. Cloud
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_2010_00_chd,"Upon analyzing the data from the lifespring, I discovered a new crafting chip."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_2100_00_chd,Please search the ruins deep in the forest.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_2200_00_chd,It seems these structures date back even further than the republic era.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_2300_00_chd,"It's becoming quite the adventure, isn't it!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_2400_00_chd,Great job on defeating those monsters.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_2500_00_chd,I have created a combat course based on the battle data and added it to the battle simulator.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_2600_00_msg,I handled the balance adjustments. Please give it a try!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_2700_00_msg,Great job!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_2800_00_msg,We've gathered quite a lot of data on the monsters inhabiting Gongaga.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_2900_00_msg,"On behalf of the Master, allow me to express our gratitude. Thank you."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_3000_00_chd,"Please don't speak for me, MAI. Honestly. But, of course, I am grateful."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_3100_00_chd,"As a token of thanks, I've prepared another combat course for you."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_3200_00_chd,Please come by and try it out anytime.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_3300_00_chd,"Cloud, all the monster subjugation requests in Gongaga are complete."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_3400_00_chd,"I've also added a new combat course, so please check it out as well."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_3500_00_msg,"The Master has it easy, just watching from afar."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_3600_00_chd,"You're just watching too, MAI."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_3700_00_msg,I provide Cloud-sama with thorough support on-site.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_3800_00_msg,"I will guide you to make your battles easier, and occasionally lighten the mood with a joke."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_3900_00_chd,"Cloud, if MAI gets annoying, just let me know anytime."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_4000_00_chd,"In the shrine of Gongaga, you should be able to obtain information about the summon spirit Kujata."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_4100_00_chd,Kujata has been passed down in Gongaga as the guardian of the forest.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_4200_00_chd,"Thus, when there was an accident at the mako reactor..."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_4300_00_chd,"it caused quite an uproar, with many believing it was due to Kujata's wrath."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_4400_00_chd,Legend has it that Kujata changes its appearance each time it appears before humans.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_4500_00_chd,"Sometimes it is enveloped in flames, sometimes cloaked in ice, and sometimes surrounded by lightning."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_4600_00_chd,"For this reason, the people of Gongaga have long revered Kujata as the embodiment of nature itself."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_4700_00_chd,"According to Gongaga's legends, Kujata..."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_4710_00_chd,"It can control the three elements: fire, ice, and lightning."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_4800_00_chd,It also has a powerful technique called 'Tri-Disaster' that combines all three elements.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_4900_00_chd,"I imagine it must be scorching, freezing, and electrifying!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_5000_00_chd,"With this, we have fully analyzed all the crystals in Gongaga. Thank you for your hard work."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_5100_00_chd,"I'm sure Kujata is ecstatic, snorting with excitement."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_5200_00_chd,"But it appears you still don't have the summon materia, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0500_5300_00_chd,"First, try challenging the summon in the battle simulator!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_0100_00_chd,"Cloud, I've discovered the whereabouts of an extremely dangerous monster."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_0200_00_chd,A malevolent dragon that has been dormant in the Cosmo Canyon area seems to have awakened.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_0300_00_chd,We must defeat it before the red earth is further stained with blood!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_0400_00_chd,"Well done, Cloud! Thanks to you, we've obtained invaluable biological data."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_0500_00_chd,"By studying this long-lived dragon, we should be able to uncover more about the history of Cosmo Canyon."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_0600_00_msg,"Master, all you ever talk about is data. Can't you show some concern for Cloud!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_0700_00_msg,"Are you hurt, Cloud?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_0800_00_chd,"Heh, you're too soft, MAI."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_0900_00_chd,"I'm always observing Cloud, after all."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_1000_00_chd,I can tell if he's injured just by looking at him.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_1100_00_chd,"Cloud, you can rest assured, I know more about your physical condition than you do!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_1200_00_chd,"Cloud, I've analyzed the Lifestream data..."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_1300_00_chd,I've pinpointed the location of an old Republic transmuter chip.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_1400_00_chd,"Look for a weathered, old ship as a landmark and search the surrounding area."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_1500_00_chd,"It's a unique sight, so you should find it easily."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_1600_00_chd,Cloud!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_1610_00_chd,"By analyzing the information from the Lifestream, I've discovered a new transmuter chip."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_1700_00_chd,It seems to be buried in the ruins near the Cosmo Mountains.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_1800_00_chd,The ruins are currently under investigation...
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_1900_00_chd,It's believed they were built by the Ancients or a similar race.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_2000_00_chd,"Since it's a rare opportunity, how about exploring the ruins while you search for the craft chip?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_2100_00_chd,"As expected of you, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_2200_00_chd,"After gathering the monster data, we can integrate it into the battle simulator—"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_2300_00_msg,I designed the combat course!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_2400_00_chd,"Indeed, MAI did help, but 'I' am the one who created it."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_2500_00_chd,Hmph... Please give it a try.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_2600_00_msg,"Magnificent work, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_2700_00_msg,How did you find the monsters in Cosmo Area?
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_2800_00_chd,It's clear from the combat data that they were no match for you.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_2900_00_msg,"I wasn't asking you, Chadley."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_3000_00_msg,"I was just getting to know Cloud better, thank you very much."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_3010_00_msg,So don't interrupt us—
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_3100_00_chd,Cloud!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_3200_00_chd,I've prepared a new combat course for you to challenge.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_3300_00_chd,Great job! You've completed all the monster eliminations in the Cosmo area.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_3400_00_msg,The monsters here are as rugged as the harsh land they inhabit.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_3500_00_msg,"Without my guidance, even someone like you might have struggled, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_3600_00_msg,"Right, Chadley?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_3700_00_chd,We used data from those monsters to create a new combat course.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_3800_00_chd,I hope you'll take on the challenge.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_3900_00_msg,"…Wait, are you ignoring me?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_4000_00_chd,"In this area, you'll find a new Bahamut shrine."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_4100_00_chd,This evolved god of destruction is called 'Bahamut Kai.'
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_4200_00_chd,"It's clad in armor the color of Cosmo Canyon's red soil, and has a biological engine on its back."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_4300_00_chd,"In terms of both defense and mobility, it far exceeds the original Bahamut."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_4400_00_chd,According to a legend passed down in this canyon...
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_4500_00_chd,"Long ago, a severely wounded Bahamut hid itself around here after a fierce battle."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_4600_00_chd,"It's said that over many years, it received the blessing of the red earth and took on a crimson form."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_4700_00_chd,One of the legends in the Cosmo area goes like this:
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_4800_00_chd,The revived crimson Bahamut roared mightily toward the earth.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_4810_00_chd,"A massive fissure split the land, forming the canyon."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_4900_00_chd,"It's such a fitting tale for a god of destruction, it almost makes you laugh, doesn’t it?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_5000_00_chd,"With this, we have analyzed all the crystals in Cosmo Area. Good job."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_5100_00_chd,"However, I am concerned about making Bahamut Arisen any stronger."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_5200_00_chd,It's a mix of reassuring and terrifying feelings.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_5300_00_chd,"But you don't have any summon materia yet, right, Cloud?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0600_5400_00_chd,"First, try challenging the summon in the battle simulator!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_0100_00_chd,"Cloud, I've obtained information about a rare monster from the lifespring."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_0200_00_chd,We've discovered the lair of a beast that rules the skies of Nibel: the King Zu.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_0300_00_chd,"Apparently, the black-robed figures have been attacked by it. Please investigate and take it down as soon as possible."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_0700_00_msg,Great work taking down the King Zu!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_0800_00_msg,Mistaking you for prey was its downfall. You skillfully defeated the ruler of the skies.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_0900_00_msg,"Now, the black-robed figures should be able to live in Nibel in peace!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_1700_00_chd,"Cloud, I analyzed the lifespring data."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_1800_00_chd,I've pinpointed where an old republic transmuter chip is buried.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_1900_00_chd,Please search a nearby island.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_2000_00_chd,"After discovering mako in Nibel, Shinra built a defense base on that island."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_2100_00_chd,"The Shinra base has already been dismantled, so there's no need to worry about them attacking."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_2200_00_msg,"Thank you so much, Cloud! The combat data you provided is invaluable."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_2300_00_msg,I can enhance my guidance capabilities even further with this!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_2400_00_chd,That's not how valuable data should be used.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_2500_00_msg,"Oh, come on!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_2600_00_chd,I've used the data to create a new combat course.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_2700_00_chd,Feel free to try it out in the battle simulator when you have time.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_2800_00_msg,That completes the Nibel combat assignments. How was my guidance?
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_2900_00_chd,MAI tends to talk a bit too much. I'll adjust the settings to reduce her chatter.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_3000_00_msg,"Oh no, Cloud! Master is being mean to me!"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_3100_00_chd,"Anyway, thanks to you, Cloud, I was able to create a new combat course."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_3200_00_chd,"I'm confident in this one, so please give it a try."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_3300_00_chd,Cloud.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_3400_00_chd,"It's been a while since our last investigation, so let me explain the situation."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_3500_00_chd,A black-robed individual with an Ancient Materia should be somewhere on this island.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_3600_00_chd,This will be the last part of our Nibelheim investigation. Please make sure you're well-prepared before heading out.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_3700_00_chd,"Within the Nibel sanctuaries lies the knowledge of Odin, the knight who governs war and death."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_3800_00_chd,"Riding his steed Sleipnir, Odin comes from the land of the dead..."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_3900_00_chd,and reaps the lives of warriors... or so many legends tell.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_4000_00_chd,According to the legends of Nibelheim...
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_4100_00_chd,They say Odin's Zantetsuken can cut through anything.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_4110_00_chd,"It can slice through space, time, and even existence itself."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_4200_00_chd,Heh heh... I'm sorry.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_4300_00_chd,"I couldn't help but imagine you getting sliced in half, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_4400_00_chd,There's an old legend that beyond Mt. Nibel lies the land of the dead.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_4500_00_chd,This has led to the belief that Odin serves as the gatekeeper of the afterlife.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_4600_00_chd,It's said he turns back those who are not yet meant to die.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_4700_00_chd,I've finished analyzing all the crystals in Nibel. Thank you for your help!
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_4800_00_chd,Let's make Odin even stronger and have him send our enemies to the land of the dead.
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_4900_00_chd,"But you don't have the summon materia yet, do you, Cloud?"
$WORLD_CDV_02_0700_5000_00_chd,"First, please challenge the summon in the battle simulator!"
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_0100_00_chd,Congratulations! You've been promoted to 'Blood Squire'.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_0200_00_chd,"As such, I have some intel for you."
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_0300_00_chd,It seems there's a skilled player called 'Cameron the Wanderer' in Side Junon.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_0400_00_chd,I believe he'd be a great challenge for you now.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_0410_00_chd,You should definitely give it a try.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_0500_00_chd,Congratulations! You’ve been promoted to 'Blood Knight'.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_0600_00_chd,"Cloud, I have new intel on a potential opponent for you."
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_0700_00_chd,There's a mysterious player known as 'Navalan the Hundred-Eyed' in North Corel.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_0800_00_chd,"With your skills as a Knight, you should be able to win. If you’re interested, you should challenge him."
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_0900_00_chd,Congratulations! You've been promoted to 'Blood Captain'.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_1000_00_chd,Cloud!
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_1100_00_chd,"I've received information that the AI robot Wize, which you fought on the ferry, has undergone an upgrade."
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_1110_00_chd,It appears to be in the Dustbowl now.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_1200_00_chd,I suggest you challenge it again to see how much stronger it has become.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_1300_00_chd,"I’ve also gathered information on another contender for you, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_1400_00_chd,There seems to be a high-performance card battle robot named 'Wize' in the Dustbowl.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_1500_00_chd,I recommend you challenge it to test its performance.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_1600_00_chd,"Congratulations, Cloud. You have reached the rank of 'Blood Tactician'."
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_1700_00_chd,Speaking of which!
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_1800_00_chd,"I've received intel that Reggie, the genius card battler you met on the ferry, is staying in Gongaga."
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_1900_00_chd,A strategist versus a genius... I have a feeling it’ll be an exceptional bout.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_2000_00_chd,"Please, do give it a try."
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_2100_00_chd,Congratulations! You've reached the rank of Blood Marquis.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_2200_00_chd,A message addressed to Marquis Cloud has arrived.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_2300_00_chd,"It says: ""I'll be waiting for you at the hotel in Gold Saucer. From, your dear specter."""
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_2400_00_chd,Could this be an invitation for a bout?
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_2500_00_chd,Congratulations! You've reached the rank of Blood Sovereign.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_2600_00_chd,Your last opponent remains: the Beast of Chaos.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_2700_00_chd,"I don’t know their abilities, but I'm confident you can win as the Sovereign."
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_2800_00_chd,Defeat the beast and claim the witch's card!
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_3600_00_chd,I see you've successfully acquired the Emerald Witch.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_3700_00_chd,"After analyzing the energy emitted from the Witch's card,"
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_3800_00_chd,I have pinpointed the location of the Crimson Queen.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_3900_00_chd,It seems the queen is within the ruins in the Gongaga area.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_4000_00_chd,The tale of the Queen's Blood is reaching its climax.
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_4100_00_chd,"Only you, Cloud, the Bloodstained Executioner, can face her."
$WORLD_CDV_03_0100_4200_00_chd,I'm counting on you!
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_0100_00_msg,Warning! Warning!

$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_0700_00_msg,"From now on, I will support your monster-fighting endeavors!"
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_0800_00_msg,"Without further ado, a special monster has been detected ahead."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_0900_00_msg,"Mr. Cloud, please gather biological data by completing battle missions."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_1000_00_msg,I will accompany you as your guide. Let's do our best together!
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_1100_00_msg,Let's get started. We've arrived at the habitat of a special monster.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_1200_00_msg,It seems the target is hiding somewhere.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_1300_00_msg,"Master Cloud, please make sure you're fully equipped before summoning the monster."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_1400_00_msg,I will accompany you as your guide. Let's do our best together!
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_1500_00_msg,"Detecting a powerful monster nearby. Everyone, get ready for battle!"
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_1600_00_msg,I'm picking up a monster signal in the vicinity. Let's get to the investigation right away.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_1700_00_msg,"Everyone, please be careful. I sense a monster's presence."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_1800_00_msg,Gathering information on the monster...
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_1900_00_msg,Analyzing ecological data...
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_2000_00_msg,Scanning the surrounding area...
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_2100_00_msg,Updating data...
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_2200_00_msg,"Go team, go!"
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_2300_00_msg,You all can do it!

$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_3200_00_msg,I feel so reassured!
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_3300_00_msg,No enemies can stand in your way!
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_3400_00_msg,I'm starting to feel sorry for them.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_3500_00_msg,Are you alright?
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_3600_00_msg,"Oh no, what should I do?!"
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_3700_00_msg,Heal up while you have the chance!
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_3800_00_msg,"Everyone, please stay calm!"

$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_4800_00_msg,Great job eliminating the threat. Let's aim to complete all objectives next time.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_4900_00_msg,"That was an amazing battle, but we missed a few objectives. How about another try?"
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_5000_00_msg,Mission incomplete~ We'll be waiting for your revenge!
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_5100_00_msg,"Oh my, it looks like there are missions left. Feel free to try again anytime!"

$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_5300_00_msg,"Thank you for the hard work in defeating the targets. Thanks to you, we've obtained valuable data."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_5400_00_msg,Great job! How was my guidance?
$WORLD_MGV_01_0100_5500_00_msg,We've gathered amazing data. I'm sure the master will be delighted.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_0100_00_msg,"Master Cloud, we've arrived at the habitat of the Quetzalcoatl."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_0200_00_msg,Make sure you're fully prepared before attempting to lure it out!
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_0300_00_msg,Quetzalcoatl sighting confirmed.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_0400_00_msg,Initiating guidance protocol now.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_0500_00_msg,"Quetzalcoatl is a beautiful creature, appearing as a cross between a bird and a dragon."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_0600_00_msg,"Its solitary nature adds to its mystique, making it a revered god-like figure."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_0700_00_msg,"While Quetzalcoatl usually avoids humans, sightings have increased in recent years."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_0800_00_msg,"Due to the impact of Mako mining, it can no longer hunt its usual prey and has turned to attacking livestock."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_0900_00_msg,Gathering information on Quetzalcoatl should help us find a way to coexist with it.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_1000_00_msg,Please assist us in this investigation!
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_1200_00_msg,Rare biolat variant identified.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_1300_00_msg,Commencing guidance.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_1400_00_msg,Biolats have a stench gland that emits a pungent odor to fend off predators while steadily increasing their numbers.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_1500_00_msg,This rare variant secretes a highly toxic fluid from its stench gland and attacks in groups.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_1600_00_msg,"They are known to defeat creatures much larger than themselves, such as elphadunks."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0200_1700_00_msg,"The damage caused by biolats, which can squeeze into any small space, has been steadily increasing year after year."

$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_1500_00_art,"Alright, let's explore!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_1600_00_red,The communications tower is waiting for us.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_1700_00_red,We're almost to the communications tower.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_1800_00_red,Shall we go wake up the sleeping tower?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_1900_00_red,How about a race to the communications tower?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_2000_00_red,The communications tower is waiting for us.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_2100_00_red,I get excited whenever I spot a communication tower.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_2200_00_yfi,Found a communication tower!
$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_2300_00_yfi,I love high places!
$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_2400_00_yfi,"Hold on, little tower! We're coming!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_2500_00_yfi,"Hehe, ready to broadcast some signals?"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_2600_00_yfi,"Alright, that tower will be mine too!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_2700_00_cat,"Hey, isn't that a communication tower?"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_2800_00_cat,We're almost at the communication tower.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0100_2900_00_cat,Shall we activate that communication tower too?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_0100_00_blt,"Hey, look! Chocobo footprints!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_0200_00_blt,Looks like there's a flock of chocobos around.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_0300_00_blt,Seems like there are chocobos nearby.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_0400_00_tif,Those are chocobo footprints.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_0500_00_tif,Looks like there might be chocobos nearby.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_0600_00_tif,I can sense chocobos close by.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_0700_00_art,"Ah, chocobo footprints!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_0800_00_art,Wanna go make some chocobo friends?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_0900_00_art,Do you think we'll meet some chocobos?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_1000_00_red,I can smell chocobos...
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_1100_00_red,It looks like there are chocobos around here.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_1200_00_red,Should we follow these chocobo tracks?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_1300_00_red,I want to play with a chocobo!
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_1400_00_yfi,"These are chocobo tracks, right?"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_1500_00_yfi,"Wait for us, chocobo!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_1600_00_yfi,"Kweh, kweh! How do I sound?"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_1700_00_cat,This seems to be a chocobo habitat.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0200_1800_00_cat,"Don't run away, chocobos!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_0100_00_blt,What the heck is that?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_0200_00_tif,Is that a mushroom?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_0300_00_art,"Look, it's a mushroom house!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_0400_00_red,What's with that mushroom?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_0500_00_red,"Hey, there's a house in the mushroom!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_0600_00_yfi,"Whoa, I found something weird!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_0700_00_cat,"Wow, what a great-looking mushroom."
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_0800_00_blt,"There it is, the mushroom house!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_0900_00_blt,"Heh, let's go play with the moogles."
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_1000_00_blt,Kupo kupo kupo kupooo!
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_1100_00_tif,Wanna stop by the Moogle House?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_1200_00_tif,How about playing with the moogles?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_1300_00_tif,"Wanna say hi to the moogles, kupo?"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_1400_00_art,"A moogle house, kupo~!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_1500_00_art,Want to hang out with the moogles?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_1600_00_art,I kinda want to live in a mushroom house.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_1700_00_red,Shall we greet the moogles?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_1800_00_red,Playing with the moogles might be fun.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_1900_00_red,I wanna play with the moogles!
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_2000_00_red,Wanna play tag with the moogles?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_2100_00_yfi,"Hey, I found a moogle house!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_2200_00_yfi,"Look, it's a moogle shop, kupo!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_2300_00_yfi,I wonder if that mushroom is edible?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_2400_00_cat,Shall we visit the moogle house?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0300_2500_00_cat,"Moogles are really amusing, aren't they?"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_0100_00_blt,"Alright, let's tear 'em up!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_0200_00_blt,"Monsters, huh?"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_0300_00_blt,Bring out the tough ones!
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_0400_00_tif,I can sense monsters nearby.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_0500_00_tif,Are we ready for a fight?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_0600_00_tif,We'd better be careful.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_0700_00_art,I've got a bad feeling about this.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_0800_00_art,Should we go ahead and fight?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_0900_00_art,"Be careful, there are monsters around."
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_1000_00_red,It seems like we're in monster territory.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_1100_00_red,I smell monsters.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_1200_00_red,I sense monsters. Stay alert.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_1300_00_red,"There's a monster nearby, isn't there?"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_1400_00_yfi,"Well, well, monster warning issued!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_1500_00_yfi,Aha! Monsters hiding somewhere?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_1600_00_yfi,Oh! Shall we take down some monsters?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_1700_00_cat,Aren't there monsters around?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_1800_00_cat,There might be some bizarre monsters here!
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_1900_00_msg,Detected a unique life form ahead.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0400_2000_00_msg,Monsters are present nearby. Exercise caution.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_0100_00_blt,"Is it just me, or is that glowing?"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_0200_00_tif,Is that...the lifestream?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_0300_00_art,"Wow, that's all the lifestream!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_0400_00_red,Is that spring the lifestream?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_0500_00_red,"Wow, this smell...it's so nostalgic."
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_0600_00_yfi,Is that a giant materia?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_0700_00_cat,"Look at that, a beautiful spring!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_0800_00_blt,Should we check out that lifestream spot?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_0900_00_blt,You can really feel the planet's energy here.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_1000_00_blt,The lifestream is calling us.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_1100_00_tif,The lifestream is bubbling up.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_1200_00_tif,We should check out that life spot.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_1300_00_tif,Let's see what the spring can tell us about this area.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_1400_00_art,The planet is calling out.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_1500_00_art,Shall we have a chat with the planet?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_1600_00_art,I feel at ease here.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_1700_00_red,Let's borrow some knowledge from the planet.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_1800_00_red,Shall we commune with the flow of life?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_1900_00_red,I can smell the lifestream!
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_2000_00_red,Maybe we should take a break by the spring.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_2100_00_yfi,"We're gonna check out that spring, right?"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_2200_00_yfi,"Oh wow, it's really bubbling up!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_2300_00_yfi,"Behold, the lifestream spring!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_2400_00_cat,"Well now, let's have a look at this life spot."
$WORLD_PCV_01_0500_2500_00_cat,There's a life spot here as well!
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_0100_00_blt,Is there a crafting chip buried here?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_0200_00_blt,Let's search for that crafting chip.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_0300_00_blt,"So, where's that crafting chip?"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_0400_00_tif,Looks like there might be a crafting chip around.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_0500_00_tif,I wonder if we'll find a new recipe.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_0600_00_tif,Time for the chocobo's keen sense of smell.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_0700_00_art,Are we searching for the crafting chip? Kweh?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_0800_00_art,Alright! Let's search for that crafting chip.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_0900_00_art,Where could that crafting chip be?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_1000_00_red,Shall we try looking for the crafting chip?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_1100_00_red,There might be a craft chip buried nearby.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_1200_00_red,Let's search for the craft chip!
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_1300_00_red,Where could the craft chip be?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_1400_00_yfi,"Alright, let's go look for the craft chip."
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_1500_00_yfi,I've been thinking that I wanted a new recipe.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_1600_00_yfi,"Kweh, kweh! Where's the craft chip?"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_1700_00_cat,"Well then, let's look for that buried chip."
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_1800_00_cat,"Chocobo, please find the craft chip for us!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_1900_00_blt,"If it's a chocobo, it should be able to find the craft chip, right?"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_2000_00_tif,Should we get help from a chocobo to find the craft chip?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_2100_00_art,Should we ask a chocobo to find the chip for us?
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_2200_00_red,"If it's a chocobo, it can probably find the chip."
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_2300_00_red,I should learn the trick of finding chips from a chocobo.
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_2400_00_yfi,"Come on, chocobo! Find the chip for me!"
$WORLD_PCV_01_0800_2500_00_cat,"With a chocobo's sense of smell, finding that chip should be a piece of cake."
$WORLD_PCV_01_1000_0100_00_tif,We need to hurry to where Cloud is.
$WORLD_PCV_01_1000_0200_00_tif,We can't afford to waste time.
$WORLD_PCV_01_1000_0300_00_tif,We have to get to the reactor.
$WORLD_QST_01_0100_0100_00_red,"What's that? Do you know, Cid?"
$WORLD_QST_01_0100_0200_00_cid,Hahaha!
$WORLD_QST_01_0100_0300_00_cid,I can't talk about it now.
$WORLD_QST_01_0100_0400_00_red,"So, you don't know."
$WORLD_QST_01_0100_0500_00_cid,Heh heh heh...
$WORLD_QST_01_0200_0100_00_red,Looks like we can't get any closer.
$WORLD_QST_01_0200_0200_00_red,We can't go any further than this.
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_0100_00_red,"Is that what I think it is...? Cloud, mind if I take a look?"
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_0200_00_red,It smells of the sea... and not the fresh kind. It reeks of an ancient ocean.
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_0300_00_cld,You can tell?
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_0400_00_red,"Yeah, I heard about it from my grandpa."
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_0500_00_red,"A long time ago, when the sea was at the center of the world, there was a war among pirates."
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_0600_00_red,You know the shooting game 'Pirate's Rampage'? It's based on that story.
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_0700_00_red,"Cloud, wanna hear the story?"
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_0800_00_cld,"Sure, why not."
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_0900_00_red,Leave the storytelling to me.
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_1000_00_red,"This is a story from a time when there were no planes or trains, and ships ruled the world."
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_1100_00_red,"In a certain sea, there once was a peculiar pirate who commanded monsters as his crew."
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_1200_00_red,"These pirates fought fiercely in a brutal pirate war, staining the sea red with blood."
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_1300_00_red,"Eventually, the pirate who had all seas under his control came to be known as the Pirate King."
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_1400_00_red,"On his deathbed,"
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_1500_00_red,It is said that he divided his most treasured possession into four parts and sealed them away.
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_1510_00_red,Together with monsters that served as the treasure's guardians.
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_1600_00_red,This map seems to indicate the locations of the Pirate King's hidden treasures.
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_1700_00_red,"And now, the seals on the treasures have been broken."
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_1800_00_red,We will have to face the Pirate King's awakened forces. Acquiring the treasure will not be easy.
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_1900_00_red,But that's exactly why──
$WORLD_QST_01_0300_2000_00_red,Isn't this exciting!
$WORLD_QST_01_0400_0100_00_red,"Cloud, it seems we've gathered all the pirate king's relics."
$WORLD_QST_01_0400_0200_00_red,"Now, let's revive the hidden treasure."
$WORLD_QST_01_0500_0100_00_red,"Cloud, let's make it already!"
$WORLD_QST_01_0500_0200_00_red,Where are you going? Let's just craft it here.
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_0100_00_red,"Hey, look! It's a treasure map!"
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_0200_00_red,<i>To the brave soul who has uncovered my treasure...</i>
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_0210_00_red,<i>I bestow upon you the compass that guided my pirate crew.</i>
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_0300_00_red,"<i>There are no roads across the sea. You will be at the mercy of the storms and the fog, and you may lose your way.</i>"
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_0400_00_red,"<i>You will be battered by waves and may even kneel before a cruel fate, feeling as if you might break.</i>"
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_0500_00_red,"<i>My pirate crew grew by welcoming both humans and monsters alike, treating them all as equals.</i>"
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_0600_00_red,"<i>As a result, we often became the targets of other pirate crews.</i>"
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_0610_00_red,"<i>Remember, in times of hardship, smile.</i>"
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_0700_00_red,<i>Trust in your precious comrades and enjoy the adventure. The compass will surely guide you well.</i>
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_0800_00_red,<i>May your voyage be filled with fortune and happiness.</i>
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_0900_00_red,Really!
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_1000_00_red,"That's amazing! With that compass, we might find even greater treasures!"
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_1010_00_red,I'm getting excited!
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_1100_00_cld,I'm not interested.
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_1200_00_red,Ha ha... Right.
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_1210_00_red,"We're on a great voyage to protect the planet, after all."
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_1300_00_red,"Alright, let's catch the breath of the planet on our sails and ride the lifestream's waves! Our adventure continues!"
$WORLD_QST_01_0600_1400_00_red,All aboard!
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_0100_00_rdl,Well done.
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_0200_00_rdl,As expected of someone I chose. It was worth sending the letter.
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_0300_00_cld,Letter? What letter?
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_0400_00_rdl,The inn at Kalm.
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_0410_00_rdl,"That card I sent, pretending to be the innkeeper? That was from me."
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_0500_00_rdl,And the message you got during the tournament on the ship? That was my doing too.
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_0501_00_rdl,"""To Cloud Strife, from a dear ghost."""
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_0600_00_cld,That was you?
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_0700_00_rdl,"Forgive me, but I needed a skilled player."
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_0710_00_rdl,"And you certainly lived up to expectations, appearing before me stronger than ever."
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_0800_00_rdl,But even that won't be enough.
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_0810_00_rdl,The power of the Shadowblood Queen is much greater than this.
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_0900_00_rdl,The root of all this evil is the Shadowblood Queen's card. It has a will of its own.
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_1000_00_rdl,"It drains the life force of its wielder, cursing them to death, and then moves on to the next."
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_1100_00_rdl,Many wielders have fallen victim to this card so far.
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_1110_00_rdl,Just one more death is needed for its resurrection.
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_1200_00_rdl,"Cloud, acquire the card."
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_1300_00_rdl,"You need the Emerald Witch's card, who led the people and executed the queen."
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_1400_00_rdl,"The witch's card is in Nibelheim, guarded by a chaotic beast."
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_1500_00_rdl,"Hurry, before the queen awakens..."
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_1600_00_rdl,"The witch is in Nibelheim, held by a beast of chaos."
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_1700_00_rdl,"But you can't win yet. First, increase your rank, Cloud."
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_1800_00_rdl,"Please, before the queen awakens..."
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_1900_00_rdl,The witch is held by a beast of chaos.
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_2000_00_rdl,"But now is not the time to fight. Continue your journey, Cloud."
$CARDG_QST_05_0300_2100_00_rdl,"Please, before the queen awakens..."
$CARDG_QST_11_0200_0100_00_moa,"Hey, we're shooting here!"
$CARDG_QST_11_0200_0200_00_lan,Wait!
$CARDG_QST_11_0200_0300_00_lan,Are you a card battler by any chance?
$CARDG_QST_11_0200_0400_00_lan,Yes! Lucky me!
$CARDG_QST_11_0200_0500_00_lan,"I'm Riana, a new model."
$CARDG_QST_11_0200_0510_00_lan,"Actually, for my photo book feature,"
$CARDG_QST_11_0200_0600_00_lan,I was hoping to get some shots of me playing Queen's Blood.
$CARDG_QST_11_0200_0610_00_lan,You'd be the perfect opponent!
$CARDG_QST_11_0200_0700_00_lan,Would you mind helping me?
$CARDG_QST_11_0200_0800_00_lan,"I see... You're busy, huh?"
$CARDG_QST_11_0200_0900_00_lan,Have you decided to join us?
$CARDG_QST_11_0200_1000_00_lan,I'll be sure to get some great shots of you as well!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_0100_00_chd,"Mr. Cloud, what kind of research shall we conduct today?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_0200_00_chd,How is your world report progressing?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_0300_00_chd,"If you need any help, please feel free to ask."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_0400_00_chd,Meeting you again has made my heart race.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_0410_00_chd,I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of report you'll give me.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_0500_00_chd,"Mr. Cloud, traveling is wonderful, isn't it?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_0600_00_chd,"I've come to appreciate the value of seeing and touching things for myself, albeit belatedly."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_0700_00_chd,"Hmm, checking Mr. Cloud's vitals... Your vitals are normal, but you seem a bit sleep-deprived."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_0800_00_chd,Please make sure to rest well when you can.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_0900_00_chd,Did you see the broadcast from Wutai? Tensions between Shinra and Wutai are rising.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_1000_00_chd,"I'm monitoring Shinra's actions on my end as well, but it's hard to say what might happen."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_1010_00_chd,Please be very careful.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_1100_00_chd,"Cloud, it seems you've acquired a rather unique vessel."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_1200_00_chd,"One day, I hope to build a ship or even an airship. When it's finished, I'll be sure to invite you."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_1300_00_chd,"Now, let's get to the task at hand and continue our research for the day."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_1400_00_chd,I might have talked a bit too much. What can I do for you today?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_1500_00_chd,"Well then, let's get to the main topic."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_1600_00_chd,"I see you've arrived in Kalm as well, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_1700_00_chd,Look at this beautiful townscape. It's no wonder it's ranked number one as the town Shinra employees most want to move to.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_1710_00_chd,"Seeing it for myself, I think I understand why."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_1800_00_chd,Have you seen the mako tank in Kalm?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_1900_00_chd,"It stores the mako sent from Midgar, since Kalm doesn't have its own reactor."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_1910_00_chd,Kalm's unique mako supply system is fascinating.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_2000_00_chd,I did a bit of research on the history of this town.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_2100_00_chd,"It appears that Kalm developed as a resting place for travelers during the republic era, supporting the grassland transportation network."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_2200_00_chd,It also played a significant role during Midgar's construction.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_2300_00_chd,"Apparently, this town was rebuilt by Shinra about ten years ago."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_2400_00_chd,"For some reason, however, records from that period have been erased, leaving the details unknown. What could have happened?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_2500_00_chd,"Cloud, have you gone to the Mythril Mine?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_2600_00_chd,It was closed a long time ago due to a decline in demand for mythril.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_2610_00_chd,"For a while, it seems the place was bustling as a tourist hotspot."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_2700_00_chd,I bet the Mythril Mines must be beautiful.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_2800_00_chd,"Perhaps thanks to the rich grasslands, the chocobos here"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_2900_00_chd,have such calm and gentle dispositions.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_2910_00_chd,They're perfect for beginners to ride.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_3000_00_chd,Sooo... the scent of the grasslands is so soothing.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_3100_00_chd,This area flourished by using the lush grasslands to raise livestock.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_3200_00_chd,"But in recent years, production has been declining, perhaps due to the influence of the Midgar Mako Reactors."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_3300_00_chd,Welcome to the Junon Chocobo Farm.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_3400_00_chd,"Cloud, did you know about this?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_3500_00_chd,It seems they mix seaweed and fish bone powder into the chocobos' feed around here.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_3510_00_chd,That's unique to a town known for its seafood industry.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_3600_00_chd,Have you caught any Junon chocobos?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_3700_00_chd,The chocobos in this area seem to have developed strong legs from the harsh sea winds.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_3710_00_chd,Chocobos from here might even be able to climb cliffs.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_3800_00_chd,This area's topography is quite intriguing.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_3900_00_chd,It seems they used the deep inlets to transport goods inland from ships.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_4000_00_chd,I see why Junon thrived as a port city.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_4100_00_chd,There used to be many shipyards around here.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_4200_00_chd,"But ever since Shinra took over the shipbuilding industry, they all shut down."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_4300_00_chd,"Seeing the abandoned ships and factory ruins, it's kind of a lonely feeling, isn't it?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_4400_00_chd,"I see you've made your way to Under Junon as well, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_4500_00_chd,This place reminds me of the slums of Midgar. Maybe because both are covered overhead.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_4600_00_chd,"Cloud, have you been to the sea yet?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_4610_00_chd,This sea once had the capital of the republic.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_4700_00_chd,It was said to be a floating city made by linking large ships together.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_4800_00_chd,"I wanted to see it with my own eyes, but unfortunately, it sank during the war."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_4900_00_chd,Have you noticed the changing color of the sea here?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_4910_00_chd,It seems that mako gas has dissolved into the water.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_5000_00_chd,"It's a unique pollution problem caused by Junon's underwater mako reactors, but Shinra turns a blind eye."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_5100_00_chd,I hope we can find a solution.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_5200_00_chd,"Cloud, have you had anything to eat?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_5300_00_chd,Under Junon is famous for its dried fish and traditionally fermented foods.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_5400_00_chd,I tried some myself and found the smell to be quite unique.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_5500_00_chd,"If you get the chance, you should definitely give it a try."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_5600_00_chd,"Umm, do you need anything?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_5700_00_chd,Executing scan... candidate found.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_5800_00_chd,Huh? Cloud? Why are you dressed like that?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_5900_00_chd,"No, never mind. It must be some kind of secret mission, right?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6000_00_chd,"I'll do what I can to help, too!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6100_00_chd,"Now then, Captain! How may I assist you today?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6200_00_chd,Captain! How can I be of service today?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6300_00_chd,"Shake it, shake it... Sway, sway... Welcome to Costa del Sol!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6400_00_chd,"Mr. Cloud, have you tried dancing too?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6500_00_chd,"I danced for the first time, and I must say, it's quite enjoyable."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6510_00_chd,"Next time, let's dance together."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6520_00_chd,"Shake it, shake it... Sway, sway... Welcome to Costa del Sol!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6530_00_chd,"I danced for the first time, and I must say, it's quite enjoyable."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6540_00_chd,"Next time, let's dance together."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6600_00_chd,Your resort wear suits you perfectly.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6610_00_chd,"Actually, I've never been swimming before. I'm a little scared of the sea."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6700_00_chd,"Cloud, when I try going into the ocean for the first time, could you hold my hand?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6800_00_chd,I'll make sure to pick out a bathing suit in advance for the occasion.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6810_00_chd,It looks like everyone is thoroughly enjoying the resort.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6820_00_chd,Changing into swimsuits and enjoying the beach under the sun is also valuable fieldwork.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6830_00_chd,"So please, make the most of your time at Costa del Sol, even on my behalf."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_6900_00_chd,"Could it be, Cloud, are you participating in 'Costa del Amor'?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_7000_00_chd,"Really? If I had known, I would have participated too. It's a shame; we could have had a chance to have fun together."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_7100_00_chd,I'll have to find out when the next event will be held.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_7200_00_chd,Have you tried riding a wheelie?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_7300_00_chd,"I just took one on a ride, and I must say, it was quite fascinating."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_7400_00_chd,That stability... It must utilize an excellent gyroscopic sensor and attitude control program.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_7500_00_chd,I'd love to take it apart sometime.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_7600_00_chd,"Though now it's famous as a resort, Costa del Sol wasn't always that way."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_7700_00_chd,"Until the war with Junon ended, it served as a military base."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_7710_00_chd,"Afterward, Shinra redeveloped it as a retreat."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_7800_00_chd,Maybe they wanted to erase the traces of war and showcase the peace.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_7810_00_chd,"Cloud, I have some great news!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_7820_00_chd,"Wall Market's popular sweets, Materia Ice, have opened a shop here in Costa!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_7830_00_chd,Leave the research on these to me. I’ll try every flavor thoroughly and investigate them.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_7900_00_chd,"Cloud, have you tried the zipline yet?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_8000_00_chd,"Originally, it was just a means of transportation..."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_8010_00_chd,But sliding down the rope proved to be so exhilarating that it has now become a popular attraction.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_8100_00_chd,"If you ever find one, you should definitely give it a try."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_8200_00_chd,"Oh, Cloud, you're here too."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_8300_00_chd,"As you might know, when energy shifted from coal to mako..."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_8400_00_chd,coal mines around the world were forced to shut down.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_8410_00_chd,"Looking at this village, you can feel the cruel passage of time."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_8500_00_chd,It seems like the townspeople are glaring at you. Are you okay?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_8600_00_chd,"It makes me sad if people don't like you, Cloud."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_8610_00_chd,"If there's anything I can help with, please let me know."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_8700_00_chd,Have you been to the Corel mines?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_8710_00_chd,"According to records, the trolley track here is the longest in the world."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_8800_00_chd,Can you imagine sliding down that beautifully constructed track in a trolley?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_8900_00_chd,It must feel amazing.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_9000_00_chd,I've done some research on North Corel. It appears this place used to be a mining-related facility.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_9100_00_chd,"There were originally no permanent residents here, but the villagers from the former Corel village at the foot of the mountain moved here,"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_9200_00_chd,and developed it into the village it is today.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_9300_00_chd,"Hello, Cloud! Oh, it’s just the two of you today."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_9400_00_chd,"I see... I understand the situation now. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to intrude."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_9401_00_chd,"I see... I understand the situation now.<br>I'm afraid I'm intruding, aren't I?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_9500_00_chd,Please enjoy your time<br>at the Gold Saucer together.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_9501_00_chd,Please enjoy your time<br>at the Gold Saucer together.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_9600_00_chd,"Hello, Cloud!<br>Oh, you're alone today."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_9700_00_chd,I see... I understand the situation now.<br>Everyone needs time alone sometimes.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_9800_00_chd,"If you ever feel lonely, don't hesitate to call on me."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_9900_00_chd,"Hello, Cloud!<br>Are you enjoying the Gold Saucer?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_10000_00_chd,"This place was renovated about four years ago,<br> and it features the latest technology all around."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_10100_00_chd,"They're also building new attractions right now,<br>so there's even more to look forward to."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_10200_00_chd,"The Gold Saucer owns several small Mako reactors, you know."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_10300_00_chd,Due to rapid desertification...
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_10400_00_chd,"Currently, they alternate between active and dormant reactors to try and preserve the land."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_10500_00_chd,"Cloud, while you're at the Gold Saucer, try to forget about the World Report."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_10510_00_chd,Please enjoy yourself.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_10600_00_chd,"I see, the level seems quite high."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_10700_00_chd,"Heh, it's time to test my new deck."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_10800_00_chd,I'm about to have my picture taken.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_10900_00_chd,"As expected from a popular character, the competition is fierce."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_11000_00_chd,Experiencing space battles sounds fascinating.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_11100_00_chd,I wonder if the spaceship's energy is also powered by Mako.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_11200_00_chd,This place... It makes my heart race for some reason.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_11300_00_chd,Is it okay if I ride the gondola alone?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_11400_00_chd,It's fun just analyzing the different kinds of chocobos.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_11500_00_chd,"I haven't placed any bets, but so far I've been spot-on with my predictions."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_11600_00_chd,"Oh, no... I'm waiting for the actors to come out because I'd like to get their autograph."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_11700_00_chd,"After watching their performance, I became a big fan."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_11800_00_chd,Hmm... I'm considering who might make the best travel companion.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_11900_00_chd,"When it comes to stuffed animals, both appearance and how they feel are important."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_12000_00_chd,"Cloud, it's me. Chadley."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_12100_00_chd,"I've heard this place is very dangerous, so I decided to disguise myself. How do I look?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_12200_00_chd,"Costumes like these have a calming effect on people, so I shouldn't be attacked."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_12300_00_chd,"Still, things have taken quite a turn, haven't they?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_12400_00_chd,I'll do my best to help prove Barret's innocence.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_12500_00_chd,"Even though I'm hiding in this costume, I still feel nervous."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_12600_00_chd,And I can't shake the feeling that I'm being watched a lot.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_12700_00_chd,"But if anything happens to me, my defense systems will activate immediately."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_12800_00_chd,"They will eliminate any enemies, so don't worry."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_12900_00_chd,"Cloud, have you been to the desert?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_13000_00_chd,"I tried to investigate it myself, but I found it dangerous to walk in the desert in this costume."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_13010_00_chd,Make sure you all stay hydrated.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_13100_00_chd,This area used to be the residential quarters for Gold Saucer employees.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_13200_00_chd,"Over time, as the desert expanded and monsters began to appear, the staff were relocated to the lodgings above."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_13300_00_chd,"After that, Greed and his group took over, and it came to be known as Corel Prison."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_13400_00_chd,"Hello, Cloud. How was your buggy ride?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_13500_00_chd,The specialized reinforced tires on the buggy seem to handle the quicksand well.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_13510_00_chd,Now you can explore the desert freely.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_13600_00_chd,"That said, I'll be relying on you for reports about the desert from now on."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_13700_00_chd,It looks like an emergency situation.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_13800_00_chd,"I don't know what materia you might need, so make sure you're well prepared."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_13900_00_chd,The youth group in this village is well-organized. Their leader must be quite competent.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_14000_00_chd,"That woman, Cissnei, isn't just an ordinary person."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_14100_00_chd,"Cloud, have you tried any Gongaga mushrooms?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_14200_00_chd,"In Midgar, even high-end restaurants use dried ones."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_14300_00_chd,I was surprised to see freshly harvested ones as everyday fare here.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_14400_00_chd,Have you ridden the local chocobos?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_14500_00_chd,The chocobos here have adapted to the forests of Gongaga.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_14510_00_chd,They use the mushrooms not only for food but also as footholds.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_14600_00_chd,"The mushrooms benefit by spreading their spores when stepped on by chocobos, creating a symbiotic relationship."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_14700_00_chd,"You've come to study the chocobos in the Cosmo area too, haven't you, Cloud?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_14800_00_chd,"The chocobos around here are called 'Sky Chocobos,' and they're said to be able to ride the wind and glide."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_14900_00_chd,"When you get a chance to ride, please let me know what you think."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_15000_00_chd,The chocobos around here may have developed gliding abilities to cross the deep canyons.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_15200_00_chd,"Speaking of Cosmo Canyon, the red earth here comes from iron oxide in the soil."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_15300_00_chd,It's also famous for its rock salt deposits.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_15400_00_chd,The salt here is known for its mild and savory flavor. Did you know that?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_15500_00_chd,"Mr. Cloud, do you know about the energy situation in the Cosmo area?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_15600_00_chd,They don't use mako around here and still rely on windmills for energy.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_15700_00_chd,"It's fitting, given that this is the center of planetology."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_15800_00_chd,"Mr. Cloud, this is the real Cosmo Canyon! One of my long-time dreams has come true!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_15900_00_chd,"It seems that planetology and our mako-driven society are at odds, but I believe there is much they could learn from each other."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_16000_00_chd,I want to study all I can about the planetary life here!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_16100_00_chd,"Hey, Cloud, have you met Mr. Bugenhagen?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_16200_00_chd,Mr. Bugenhagen is a leading authority on planetology and an extraordinary scientist. They say he once even assisted with Shinra's research.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_16210_00_chd,I plan to attend one of his lectures next time.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_16300_00_chd,Did you know that Cosmo Canyon is also famous as an astronomical observation spot?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_16400_00_chd,They say the clear skies here make for an excellent view of the stars.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_16500_00_chd,"Cloud, you should definitely look up at the sky while you're here."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_16600_00_chd,"Cloud, the collection in this library is incredible! It's full of old documents that Shinra doesn't have."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_16700_00_chd,"Since none of them have been digitized, I'm actually secretly copying them as I read."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_16800_00_chd,"Cloud, are you here to learn about Chocobos too?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_16900_00_chd,"I've heard that the legendary chocobo sage is living here, so I decided to visit as well."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_17000_00_chd,"This mansion is much more luxurious than I imagined, I'm quite surprised."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_17010_00_chd,I never expected it to have a pool...
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_17100_00_chd,Nibelheim chocobos are fascinating.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_17200_00_chd,Chocobos that can run or fly over the sea don't exist anywhere else.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_17300_00_chd,Perhaps the sage chose to live in Nibelheim because of these sea chocobos.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_17400_00_chd,"I heard the chocobo sage was a top-notch jockey, not just a breeder."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_17500_00_chd,"It's said that thanks to the sage's methods of using chocobos, we have today's prosperity."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_17600_00_chd,He's truly an amazing person... isn't he?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_17700_00_chd,"Cloud, do you know about 'chocograss'?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_17800_00_chd,It's an unusual plant that floats around using the warm updrafts generated by sunlight.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_17810_00_chd,"Due to a lack of researchers, its details remain unknown."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_17900_00_chd,"Cloud, would you like to become the foremost expert?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_18000_00_chd,"Cloud, this place seems to be a treatment facility for mako poisoning."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_18010_00_chd,That's why there are so many people in black cloaks here.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_18100_00_chd,I've seen others in black cloaks before...
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_18200_00_chd,Perhaps they were traveling to this village.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_18300_00_chd,"Mt. Nibel has an eerie shape, doesn't it?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_18310_00_chd,"With few plants to take root, I've heard there are frequent landslides and collapses."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_18400_00_chd,"Many have lost their lives while climbing, due to the dangerous terrain."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_18410_00_chd,There's a legend that says it's connected to the land of the dead.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_18500_00_chd,"I looked into Nibelheim and found it to be a mysterious place, despite its tranquil appearance."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_18600_00_chd,Almost all the records are classified. It appears that Professor Hojo was involved.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_18700_00_chd,Nibelheim is also the first place in the world where a mako reactor was built.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_18800_00_chd,It's said that various experiments using mako were conducted here.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_18900_00_chd,Is it a mere coincidence that this place now serves as a treatment center for mako poisoning?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_19000_00_chd,Hello! I'm glad to see you're all well. What brings you here today?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_19100_00_chd,How is your progress on the World Report?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_19200_00_chd,"If you have any trouble, please don't hesitate to let me know."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_19300_00_chd,It looks like there's an emergency.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_19400_00_chd,"I'm not sure which materia you'll need, but make sure you're well-prepared."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_19500_00_chd,"Cloud, our survey of the Grasslands area is now complete!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_19600_00_chd,The data you collected while running through the grasslands was all rich and refreshing.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_19700_00_chd,I feel like I've learned about the coexistence of nature and people—something I couldn't have known in Midgar.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_19800_00_chd,Thank you for providing such a beautiful report.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_19900_00_chd,"Cloud, our survey of the Junon area is now complete!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_20000_00_chd,"By investigating this historic land exposed to the sea breeze, I gained a deeper understanding of the Republic of Junon."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_20100_00_chd,Research into a nation that once ruled the world is essential for foreseeing Shinra's future path.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_20200_00_chd,Thank you for providing such valuable data.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_20300_00_chd,"Cloud, our survey of the Corel area is now complete!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_20400_00_chd,"In the vastness of Corel, I felt that Shinra's influence was particularly evident, both for good and bad."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_20500_00_chd,The relationship between the Gold Saucer and the desert has been incredibly enlightening in terms of technological advancement.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_20600_00_chd,Thank you for providing such valuable reports.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_20700_00_chd,"Cloud, the survey of the Gongaga area is now complete!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_20800_00_chd,"By examining the entire forest, we have reaffirmed that people's lives are a part of nature."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_20900_00_chd,I was also amazed by the power of nature to reclaim even the remains of the Mako reactor.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_21000_00_chd,Thank you again for providing such interesting reports.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_21100_00_chd,"Cloud, the survey of the Cosmo Canyon area is now complete!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_21200_00_chd,Investigating the land closely tied to planetary life sciences has deepened my understanding of the planet.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_21300_00_chd,"Additionally, being exposed to perspectives different from Shinra's has greatly broadened my outlook."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_21400_00_chd,Thank you for providing your valuable report.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_21500_00_chd,"Cloud, the survey of the Nibel region is now complete!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_21600_00_chd,It's not an exaggeration to say that the current Shinra Company started from this place.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_21700_00_chd,"By investigating this land deeply connected to Mako, various issues have come to light."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_21800_00_chd,Thank you for providing such a meaningful report.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_21900_00_chd,"Thanks to you, Cloud, the survey of this area is complete."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_22000_00_chd,"However, our journey together is far from over."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_22010_00_chd,Please continue to provide reports from other areas as well.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_22100_00_chd,"Cloud, have you forgotten about the battle simulator?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_22200_00_chd,I've created a combat course using the data from the monsters you defeated.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_22300_00_chd,"Please, give it a try."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_22400_00_chd,"Cloud, you’ve accumulated a lot of data points."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_22500_00_chd,How about using them to develop some materia?
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_22600_00_chd,"Cloud, thank you for activating the communication towers!"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_22700_00_chd,The republic built those communication towers to observe the planet.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_22800_00_chd,Your exceptional exploration skills make the World Report possible.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_22810_00_chd,Please continue to activate any communication towers you find.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_22900_00_chd,"Cloud, do you know about the 'golden feathers'?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_23000_00_chd,"Among chocobo feathers, those with particularly good color and luster are called golden feathers."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_23010_00_chd,They are highly valued as decorative items and ingredients for medicine.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_23100_00_chd,"You can trade these at chocobo shops, so be sure to pick up any you find."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_23200_00_chd,"Cloud, have you noticed birds flying around the lifesprings?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_23300_00_chd,These birds have adapted to the Lifestream and are known as 'Houhou.'
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_23400_00_chd,"If you can't find a lifespring, try following these 'Houhou.'"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_23500_00_chd,Cloud!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_23600_00_chd,You can find valuable 'craft chips' buried in ancient republic ruins.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_23700_00_chd,Investigating these lifesprings can help you pinpoint where the chips are buried.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_23800_00_chd,Be sure to explore lifesprings more if you want to obtain new recipes.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_23900_00_chd,"Cloud, have you seen any rabbits around?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_24000_00_chd,It seems the rabbits around here have a habit of hiding things in their burrows.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_24100_00_chd,"If you happen to spot one, try digging up a burrow with a chocobo."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_24200_00_chd,You might be surprised at what you find!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_24300_00_chd,"Mr. Cloud, have you noticed any small chocobos around the chocobo stops?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_24400_00_chd,It seems that juvenile chocobos are attracted by the lingering scents at old stops.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_24500_00_chd,"If you spot a stray chocobo, take a look around the area."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_24600_00_chd,You might find a chocobo stop nearby.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_24700_00_chd,"Mr. Cloud, have you managed to help the moogle shop open?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_24800_00_chd,"Moogle Medals, their unique currency, are said to have a magical power that brings happiness."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_24900_00_chd,"By collecting lots of medals and giving them to the moogles, you might just bring happiness to people all over the world."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_25000_00_chd,"Mr. Cloud, how is your material collection going?"
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_25100_00_chd,"You can synthesize various items from plants, ore, and other materials you find."
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_25110_00_chd,Some of these materials can even enhance your abilities.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_25200_00_chd,Collect materials during your travels—it will surely aid you in your adventure.
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_25300_00_chd,Cloud!

$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_25600_00_chd,Cloud!
$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_25700_00_chd,"I have recreated Phoenix, the legendary bird of rebirth from Junon, in the simulator."

$WORLD_CDV_01_0100_27300_00_chd,"I hope to ride with you someday, Mr. Cloud."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_0100_00_msg,"Cloud-sama, we have arrived at the king zu's habitat."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_0200_00_msg,This is an extremely dangerous monster. Please make thorough preparations!
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_0300_00_msg,King zu sighted.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_0400_00_msg,Commencing navigation.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_0500_00_msg,"As expected of the king of the zus, it has a magnificent presence."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_0600_00_msg,"In zu society, there is a strict hierarchy, where the largest male is called the 'king.'"
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_0700_00_msg,The individual chosen as king leaves the flock and lives a solitary life.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_0800_00_msg,"One theory suggests this is to create an environment for a new king to grow, but the exact reason is unknown."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_0900_00_msg,Please conduct an extermination survey to help unravel the mystery of zu behavior.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_1100_00_msg,A rare variant of Nibel wolf detected.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_1200_00_msg,Commencing guidance protocol.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_1300_00_msg,Nivl wolves maintain a strict vertical hierarchy. Only those recognized for their strength within the pack are said to harbor a blue flame.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_1400_00_msg,"It's said that while the flame-imbued Nivl wolf draws the prey's attention, other members of the pack attack from its blind spots."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_1500_00_msg,"These wolves are highly intelligent. Many anecdotes tell of hunters who thought they had cornered the wolves, only to find themselves surrounded by the pack instead."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_1600_00_msg,This is an excellent opportunity to delve into the ecology of the cautious Nivl wolf.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_1700_00_msg,"Proceed with the investigation, but be wary of reinforcements!"
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_2000_00_msg,A rare kyuvildun variant has been detected.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_2100_00_msg,Commencing guidance protocol.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_2200_00_msg,Observe the characteristic upper jaw of the creature.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_2300_00_msg,"The kyuvildun skewers its prey with its serrated upper jaw, then skillfully uses its forelegs to cut up and bring the meal to its mouth."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_2400_00_msg,"Cubildunus are omnivores, eating anything available in their habitat, from plants to monster carcasses."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_2500_00_msg,The color and physical abilities of their bodies change depending on what they have consumed.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_2600_00_msg,"Individually, they aren't very strong, but become a real problem when they swarm."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_2700_00_msg,"To prevent damage to the town and fields, we request that you investigate and take them out!"
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_2900_00_msg,A rare variant of Valron has been confirmed.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_3000_00_msg,Commencing guide now.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_3100_00_msg,The ominous coloring of this variant seems to be for intimidating enemies.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_3200_00_msg,"Its personality is also more aggressive, attacking indiscriminately once it spots prey."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_3300_00_msg,Valrons began to be seen in this area around the time the mako reactor construction started.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_3400_00_msg,"Due to their human-like physical features, there were rumors at the time that they were humans cursed by mako exposure."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_3500_00_msg,"Setting aside the veracity of these claims, it appears that the excavation of Mt. Nibel for the reactor is indeed related to the appearance of the valrons."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_3600_00_msg,Please continue the investigation to uncover the cause of the monster appearances.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_3800_00_msg,We've confirmed the presence of a rare Belchatusk variant.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_3900_00_msg,Commencing guidance protocol.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_4000_00_msg,"As the Belchatusk evolved, it grew larger and lost its ability to fly. Instead, it developed the ability to produce a deadly toxin to defeat its enemies."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_4100_00_msg,This toxin is stored in large sacs in its cheeks and jaw.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_4200_00_msg,The toxin is generated from the insects that are a staple of its diet.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_4300_00_msg,"Because of this, the toxin's properties slightly change depending on the types of insects it consumes."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_4400_00_msg,"The toxin of the rare variants can immobilize their prey, so special caution is necessary."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0700_4500_00_msg,Please be very careful as you continue your investigation!
$CARDG_QST_08_0300_0100_00_shd,"Oh no, I lost! But...I feel much better after having a good cry!"
$CARDG_QST_08_0300_0200_00_shd,"After all, nothing beats a card bout for stress relief."
$CARDG_QST_08_0300_0300_00_shd,"Oh dear, you seem to have a lot of stress built up too."
$CARDG_QST_08_0300_0400_00_shd,I can tell just by looking at your face. A good cry bout is highly recommended!
$CARDG_QST_08_0300_0500_00_shd,You should definitely try it!
$CARDG_QST_08_0300_0600_00_shd,This is the power of a crybaby!
$CARDG_QST_08_0300_0700_00_shd,Even us crybabies can bite back...
$CARDG_QST_08_0300_0800_00_shd,"Ugh, that didn't feel refreshing at all..."
$CARDG_QST_08_0300_0900_00_shd,"Wow, I lost so spectacularly! It feels refreshing!"
$CARDG_QST_08_0300_1000_00_shd,Losing really lifts my spirits!
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_0100_00_msg,"Lord Cloud, we have arrived at the Jabberwock's habitat."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_0200_00_msg,This enigmatic monster's ecological information is extremely limited.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_0210_00_msg,Please prepare thoroughly!
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_0300_00_msg,Jabberwock sighted.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_0400_00_msg,Beginning guidance now.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_0500_00_msg,The Jabberwock is an ancient and malevolent dragon.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_0600_00_msg,Legends say it can live a thousand years without eating and split the earth with a single stomp.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_0700_00_msg,"However, recent discoveries show that it endures long periods by sinking into the red soil and petrifying itself during its dormant phase."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_0800_00_msg,The Jabberwock's active periods are exceedingly short and rare.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_0900_00_msg,This is a golden opportunity!
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_1000_00_msg,"Please, we humbly ask for your help to investigate and slay the legendary dragon!"
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_1200_00_msg,We've confirmed a rare variant of the Desert Sahagin.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_1300_00_msg,Beginning the guidance now.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_1400_00_msg,"As the name implies, the Desert Sahagin is closely related to the ones living in Midgar's sewers."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_1500_00_msg,"Though they have adapted to the desert, they possess the same social behavior and intelligence as the sahagins, and are known to hunt in groups using weapons."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_1600_00_msg,It is said that the warriors of Cosmo Canyon once used the carapaces of Desert Sahagins for shields.
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_1700_00_msg,"With those fierce spikes, these shields must have served an offensive purpose as well."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_1800_00_msg,The sahagins have the advantage of being on their home turf. Let's band together and make sure none of us fall victim to them!
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_2200_00_msg,We've confirmed a rare variant of the Skeeskee.

$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_5600_00_msg,"Years have passed since the golems lost their masters, and the impurities from the lifestream that have accumulated inside them have made them more violent over time."
$WORLD_MGV_01_0600_5700_00_msg,The surrounding residents are suffering greatly. Please investigate and eliminate the threat.
