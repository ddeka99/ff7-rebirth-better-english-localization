$C1910_MAIN_8000_0100_00_cld,That's where my memory stops. I don't remember anything after that.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_0200_00_blt,"Hold on, hold on, hold on! What the hell happened!?"
$C1910_MAIN_8000_0300_00_art,The news was everywhere. I remember watching it with my mom.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_0310_00_art,They announced that Sephiroth had gone missing during a training mission.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_0400_00_art,"But then...a few days later, they reported he was actually killed in action."
$C1910_MAIN_8000_0500_00_art,"Yeah, that's it!"
$C1910_MAIN_8000_0600_00_blt,The news is all controlled by Shinra. They do whatever they want.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_0700_00_blt,Only idiots believe that crap!
$C1910_MAIN_8000_0700_05_art,Aerith
$C1910_MAIN_8000_0800_00_art,"Well, I believed it. Does that make me an idiot?"
$C1910_MAIN_8000_0900_00_blt,Ah... I didn't mean it that way.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_0910_00_blt,"Anyway, it's all Shinra's fault."
$C1910_MAIN_8000_1000_00_cld,"Regardless of the truth from five years ago, we fought Sephiroth in Midgar."
$C1910_MAIN_8000_1100_00_cld,He's still alive.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_1200_00_art,Alive? Or just... present?
$C1910_MAIN_8000_1300_00_tif,Why did he show up now?
$C1910_MAIN_8000_1400_00_tif,What was he doing for those five years?
$C1910_MAIN_8000_1500_00_cld,Sephiroth is picking up where he left off.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_1600_00_cld,Continuing his plan to reclaim the planet with Jenova and become its ruler.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_1700_00_tif,After all these years?
$C1910_MAIN_8000_1800_00_tif,"Sorry to keep bringing this up, but I can't stop thinking about it."
$C1910_MAIN_8000_1900_00_blt,And I still don't get what this Jenova thing is all about.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_2010_00_art,Sorry.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_2100_00_art,Guess I'm just not used to the wilderness. My back is killing me.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_2200_00_tif,Let me see.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_2400_00_tif,That's bad.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_2500_00_tif,But I might be able to help. Let's go to the room.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_2600_00_blt,"Alright, let's call it a night."
$C1910_MAIN_8000_2700_08_blt,Red...
$C1910_MAIN_8000_2700_07_blt,Oh no you don't! That bed's mine.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_2700_00_blt,There's no way we could understand what Sephiroth is up to.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_2800_00_art,Good night.
$C1910_MAIN_8000_2900_08_blt,Barret...
$C1910_MAIN_8000_2900_00_tif,Good night.
$C1910_MAIN_8100_0100_00_tif,"Aerith, are you asleep?"
$C1910_MAIN_8100_0200_00_art,"No, just barely."
$C1910_MAIN_8100_0300_00_tif,"Wonder what Cloud's been up to these past five years, and where he's been."
$C1910_MAIN_8100_0400_00_art,Why are you asking <i>me</i>?
$C1910_MAIN_8100_0500_00_tif,Figured you might know everything.
$C1910_MAIN_8100_0600_00_art,I probably did at some point.
$C1910_MAIN_8100_0610_00_art,But it was taken away from me.
$C1910_MAIN_8100_0700_00_art,"Or, maybe erased?"
$C1910_MAIN_8100_0800_00_tif,By the Whispers?
$C1910_MAIN_8100_0900_00_art,Probably.
$C1910_MAIN_8100_1000_00_tif,Could it be that I was taken too?
$C1910_MAIN_8100_1100_00_art,Taken? What do you mean?
$C1910_MAIN_8100_1200_00_tif,"In my memory, Cloud never came to Nibelheim five years ago."
$C1910_MAIN_8200_0200_00_tif,Cloud. You awake?
$C1910_MAIN_8500_0100_00_tif,Sorry. Did I wake you?
$C1910_MAIN_8500_0200_00_cld,Nope. What's up?
$C1910_MAIN_8500_0300_00_tif,"Oh, no... It's just that<br> I have something to ask."
$C1910_MAIN_8500_0400_00_tif,Can we talk for a bit?
$C1910_MAIN_8500_0500_00_cld,Sure.
$C1910_MAIN_8500_0600_00_tif,Let's move somewhere else then.
$C1910_MAIN_8500_0700_00_tif,"This way, follow me."
$C1910_MAIN_8600_0100_00_sep,You know that I killed Tifa.
$C1910_MAIN_8600_0200_00_sep,Then who is that?
$C1910_MAIN_8600_0210_00_sep,"Honestly, there's no room for error."
$C1910_MAIN_8700_0100_00_brd,You don't look so well. Is it an old battlefield injury giving you trouble?
$C1910_MAIN_8700_0200_00_brd,"I can relate. I used to work for Shinra too. Now I run this modest inn, but sometimes those old wounds still ache."
$C1910_MAIN_8700_0300_00_brd,"Of course, it was a long time ago when I was with Shinra..."
$C1910_MAIN_8700_0400_00_brd,Why don't you rest in your room for a bit?
$C1910_MAIN_8800_0100_00_tif,Do you think Midgar's that way?
$C1910_MAIN_8800_0200_00_tif,"So, um..."
$C1910_MAIN_8800_0300_00_cld,There's something I need to ask too.
$C1910_MAIN_8800_0400_00_tif,Go ahead.
$C1910_MAIN_8800_0500_00_cld,"Five years ago, that day...at the reactor.<br>I saw you, Tifa."
$C1910_MAIN_8800_0600_00_cld,"You were badly hurt, bleeding heavily."
$C1910_MAIN_8800_0610_00_cld,I thought it was too late.
$C1910_MAIN_8800_0700_00_tif,Yeah...?
$C1910_MAIN_8800_0800_00_tif,"So, you think I'm not really me,<br>that I'm someone else?"
$C1910_MAIN_8800_0900_00_tif,"I never thought you'd doubt me like this,<br>but here we are."
$C1910_MAIN_8800_1000_00_tif,"Look, here."
$C1910_MAIN_8800_1100_00_tif,See the scar from back then?
$C1910_MAIN_8800_1200_00_tif,It was Zangan who saved me at the reactor.
$C1910_MAIN_8800_1300_00_tif,He risked his life carrying me down the river.
$C1910_MAIN_8800_1400_00_tif,"The doctor worked all night to operate on me, and the nurses watched over me constantly."
$C1910_MAIN_8800_1600_00_tif,"Thanks to all those people, I survived."
$C1910_MAIN_8800_1700_00_tif,"And what about you, Cloud?"
$C1910_MAIN_8800_1800_00_tif,What were you doing after you left the village?
$C1910_MAIN_8800_1900_00_tif,For the past five years?
$C1910_MAIN_8800_2000_00_cld,I have my secrets.
$C1910_MAIN_8800_2100_00_tif,"Yes, I suppose you can't."
$C1910_MAIN_8800_2200_00_tif,"Sorry, I need to go back to my room."
$C1910_MAIN_8900_0100_00_tif,"We weren't really that close as childhood friends, were we?"
$C1910_MAIN_8900_0200_00_cld,Maybe not.
$C1910_MAIN_8900_0300_00_tif,"I was so excited to see you again, maybe I got carried away."
$C1910_MAIN_9000_0100_00_blt,You two get into it?
$C1910_MAIN_9000_0200_00_cld,Nope.
$C1910_MAIN_9000_0300_00_blt,We don't need any more trouble.
$C1910_MAIN_9000_0310_00_blt,Got it?
$C1910_MAIN_9000_0400_00_cld,I'm turning in.
$C1910_MAIN_9000_0500_00_red,The night always ends.
$C1920_MAIN_0100_0100_00_cld,What's this?
$C1920_MAIN_0100_0200_00_brd,It's a little something from our inn.
$C1920_MAIN_0100_0300_00_brd,Please feel free to use it as a tool to start conversations.
$C1920_MAIN_0100_0400_00_cld,Queen's Blood?
$C1920_MAIN_0200_0100_00_brd,Good morning.
$C1920_MAIN_0200_0110_00_brd,"Apologies for the delayed introduction. I'm Broden, the owner of this inn."
$C1920_MAIN_0200_0120_00_brd,Your companions have already gone out.
$C1920_MAIN_0200_0200_00_brd,"Oh, right. I have a message from Barret for you."
$C1920_MAIN_0200_0300_00_brd,"'Hey, sleepyhead SOLDIER. You're free to do as you please today.'"
$C1920_MAIN_0200_0400_00_brd,'Take this chance to check your gear.'
$C1920_MAIN_0200_0410_00_brd,...That's what he said.
$C1920_MAIN_0200_0500_00_brd,How about heading to the weapon shop first?
$C1920_MAIN_0200_0600_00_cld,Good idea.
$C1920_MAIN_0200_0700_00_brd,"Oh, and Cloud—do you have any skill books on you?"
$C1920_MAIN_0200_0800_00_cld,Yeah.
$C1920_MAIN_0200_0900_00_brd,"In that case, you might also want to visit the bookstore while you’re at it."
$C1920_MAIN_0200_1000_00_brd,The bookstore in Kalm is actually the very first store of a renowned chain specializing in magical texts.
$C1920_MAIN_0200_1010_00_brd,I believe they offer a special service for first-time visitors.
$C1920_MAIN_0200_1100_00_brd,Experienced specialists are there to help you unlock new abilities.
$C1920_MAIN_0200_1110_00_brd,"They'll customize your skill books, and the first customization is free."
$C1920_MAIN_0300_0200_00_brd,"Kalm is a quaint, charming little town."
$C1920_MAIN_0300_0300_00_brd,Feel free to explore and take in the sights.
$C1920_MAIN_0300_0400_00_brd,Have you visited the weapon shop and bookstore yet?
$C1920_MAIN_0310_0100_00_red,Awake at last?
$C1920_MAIN_0310_0110_00_red,You must have been really exhausted.
$C1920_MAIN_0310_0200_00_cld,Were you waiting for me?
$C1920_MAIN_0310_0300_00_red,I wanted to properly thank you.
$C1920_MAIN_0310_0310_00_red,"Thanks to you, I managed to escape from Hojo's grasp."
$C1920_MAIN_0310_0400_00_cld,Just happened that way.
$C1920_MAIN_0310_0500_00_red,"Even so, I owe you a debt."
$C1920_MAIN_0310_0510_00_red,I'll be with you for a while to repay that debt.
$C1920_MAIN_0310_0600_00_red,By the way...
$C1920_MAIN_0310_0610_00_red,"If you're going to check your equipment, could you check mine too?"
$C1920_MAIN_0310_0700_00_cld,Understood.
$C1920_MAIN_0310_0800_00_cld,Quite the confident rookie.
$C1920_MAIN_0400_0100_00_tif,Morning.
$C1920_MAIN_0400_0200_00_cld,Morning.
$C1920_MAIN_0400_0300_00_tif,Everyone's kinda off doin' their own thing.
$C1920_MAIN_0400_0400_00_cld,I noticed.
$C1920_MAIN_0400_0500_00_tif,"Say, uh... This tank remind you of anything?"
$C1920_MAIN_0400_0510_00_sys,Does this tank remind you of anything?
$C1920_MAIN_0400_0520_00_sys,The place I made that promise to you.
$C1920_MAIN_0400_0530_00_sys,The water tower in Nibelheim.
$C1920_MAIN_0400_0540_00_sys,Just an ordinary mako tank.
$C1920_MAIN_0400_0600_00_cld,Yeah. The place I made that promise to you.
$C1920_MAIN_0400_0700_00_tif,You remember that dress from back then? It was one of my favorites.
$C1920_MAIN_0400_0800_00_cld,"Yeah, the one that was sort of light blue, with a hint of green?"
$C1920_MAIN_0400_0900_00_tif,Uh-huh.
$C1920_MAIN_0400_1000_00_cld,Kinda reminds me of the water tower in Nibelheim.
$C1920_MAIN_0400_1100_00_tif,Right?
$C1920_MAIN_0400_1110_00_tif,"It was such a special place, but now it's gone."
$C1920_MAIN_0400_1200_00_cld,Just another mako tank.
$C1920_MAIN_0400_1300_00_tif,Yeah... I guess so.
$C1920_MAIN_0400_1400_00_cld,"Makes you think, though... How the mako in it came all the way from Midgar."
$C1920_MAIN_0400_1500_00_tif,"Yeah, it does make you wonder..."
$C1920_MAIN_0500_0100_00_tif,This town is so calming and nice.
$C1920_MAIN_0500_0200_00_tif,I feel like I'm starting to relax... Is that okay?
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0100_00_blt,"Well, look who's up early."
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0200_00_cld,"Already drinking, are we?"
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0300_00_blt,"Nah, it's not booze."
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0310_00_blt,No drinks till we rebuild Seventh Heaven.
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0320_00_sys,No drinks till we rebuild Seventh Heaven.
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0330_00_sys,First round's on me.
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0340_00_sys,That'll be some good booze.
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0350_00_sys,But not anytime soon.
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0400_00_cld,"When that time comes, the drinks are on me."
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0500_00_blt,Now that's what I like to hear!
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0510_00_blt,Gotta remember to stock up on some top-shelf stuff then.
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0600_00_cld,That first drink's gonna taste great.
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0700_00_blt,Hell yeah! Gonna throw a big ol' opening bash and party like crazy!
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0800_00_cld,Looks like that'll have to wait for a while.
$C1920_MAIN_0600_0900_00_blt,We'll be back to it before you know it.
$C1920_MAIN_0700_0100_00_blt,Looks like it's gonna be a long journey. Make sure you're well prepared.
$C1920_MAIN_0700_0200_00_blt,Don't go buying any souvenirs yet. They'll just add to the load.
$C1920_MAIN_0900_0100_00_red,Leave the lookout to me.
$C1920_MAIN_0900_0200_00_red,Everything is normal for now.
$C1920_MAIN_1000_0100_00_art,"Good morning, Cloud."
$C1920_MAIN_1000_0200_00_cld,"Yeah, what have you been up to?"
$C1920_MAIN_1000_0300_00_art,"I've been looking for you, Cloud."
$C1920_MAIN_1000_0400_00_cld,I see.
$C1920_MAIN_1000_0500_00_art,Got something to do at the bookstore?
$C1920_MAIN_1000_0510_00_art,"Well, if you're free afterwards..."
$C1920_MAIN_1000_0600_00_art,Wanna go to the top of the tower?
$C1920_MAIN_1000_0610_00_sys,'Wanna go to the top of the tower?'
$C1920_MAIN_1000_0620_00_sys,"Yeah, let's go."
$C1920_MAIN_1000_0630_00_sys,If I must.
$C1920_MAIN_1000_0640_00_sys,I'm busy.
$C1920_MAIN_1000_0700_00_cld,"Alright, let's go."
$C1920_MAIN_1000_0800_00_art,Really!? Awesome!
$C1920_MAIN_1000_0900_00_cld,...If I must.
$C1920_MAIN_1000_1000_00_art,"Oh, come on!"
$C1920_MAIN_1000_1010_00_art,"But, I guess it's okay."
$C1920_MAIN_1000_1100_00_cld,I'm busy.
$C1920_MAIN_1000_1200_00_art,"Oh, come on! It'll only take a few minutes, please!"
$C1920_MAIN_1000_1300_00_cld,Fine.
$C1920_MAIN_1000_1400_00_art,Sweet!
$C1920_MAIN_1000_1500_00_art,I'll go get the tickets then.
$C1920_MAIN_1000_1510_00_art,Let's meet in front of the tower.
$C1920_MAIN_1100_0200_00_art,"I'll catch up with you later, alright?"
$C1920_MAIN_1100_0300_00_art,Don't forget. In front of the tower.
$C1920_MAIN_1200_0100_00_sma,Hey there! Welcome to Maghnata Books.
$C1920_MAIN_1200_0300_00_sma,Oh! Is this your first time customizing a skill book?
$C1920_MAIN_1200_0500_00_sma,"Well, to enhance a skill book, the owner needs a matching level of knowledge, experience, and ability."
$C1920_MAIN_1200_0510_00_sma,But you look like you'll be fine.<br>Let's give it a shot.
$C1920_MAIN_1200_0600_00_sma,"Well, this is good for a start."
$C1920_MAIN_1200_0700_00_sma,Strengthening the bond with your companions will draw out more power from the skill book.
$C1920_MAIN_1200_0800_00_sma,"If you want to enhance it again, feel free to bring it back anytime."
$C1920_MAIN_1300_0100_00_sma,Welcome!
$C1920_MAIN_1300_0200_00_sma,"Oh, you're back again!"
$C1920_MAIN_1300_0300_00_sma,What can I do for you today?
$C1920_MAIN_1300_0400_00_sma,Take your time.
$C1920_MAIN_1300_0500_00_sma,Come by anytime.
$C1920_MAIN_1300_0600_00_sma,Thank you very much!
$C1920_MAIN_1400_0100_00_sma,Welcome.
$C1920_MAIN_1400_0110_00_sma,"Whoa, that's a fine weapon you've got there."
$C1920_MAIN_1400_0200_00_sma,"It's got character, clearly seen some use."
$C1920_MAIN_1400_0400_00_sma,"But it's still got room to grow. With proper maintenance, it'll become even better."
$C1920_MAIN_1400_0500_00_sma,What do you say? Want me to give you a few tips?
$C1920_MAIN_1400_0600_00_sma,"Nice, it's looking even sharper. Your weapon’s practically smiling."
$C1920_MAIN_1400_0700_00_sma,Make sure to keep it regularly customized from now on.
$C1920_MAIN_1400_0800_00_sma,"While you're here, take a look at our wares too."
$C1920_MAIN_1400_0900_00_sma,"Take good care of your weapon, alright?"
$C1920_MAIN_1500_0100_00_sma,Back again! What can I do ya for?
$C1920_MAIN_1500_0200_00_sma,Lemme know if something piques your interest.
$C1920_MAIN_1500_0300_00_sma,"We got a great selection here, you know."
$C1920_MAIN_1500_0400_00_sma,'Preciate it.
$C1920_MAIN_1500_0500_00_sma,Hope to see you again!
$C1920_MAIN_1500_0600_00_sma,You be careful out there.
$C1920_MAIN_1600_0100_00_vrg,"Excuse me, we are still preparing."
$C1920_MAIN_1600_0200_00_vrg,Please come back later.
$C1920_MAIN_1700_0100_00_art,"They said it's not ready yet. You wanna take care of anything else in the meantime, Cloud?"
$C1920_MAIN_1800_0100_00_art,Cloud! Over here!
$C1920_MAIN_1800_0200_00_art,"Let's get started then, shall we?"
$C1920_MAIN_2200_0100_00_art,I think Midgar's this way.
$C1920_MAIN_2200_0200_00_cld,"Should be, yeah."
$C1920_MAIN_2200_0300_00_art,Funny how small it looks from here.
$C1920_MAIN_2200_0400_00_cld,It's far off in the distance.
$C1920_MAIN_2200_0500_00_art,"Hey, is there something between you and Tifa?"
$C1920_MAIN_2200_0700_00_art,"Don't be so surprised. We share a room, you know."
$C1920_MAIN_2200_0800_00_cld,Did she say anything?
$C1920_MAIN_2200_0900_00_art,"Not really, no."
$C1920_MAIN_2200_0910_00_art,But I can tell.
$C1920_MAIN_2200_1000_00_art,I'm kinda jealous you've had a childhood friend.
$C1920_MAIN_2200_1100_00_art,Don't neglect her importance.
$C1920_MAIN_2300_0100_00_blt,Damn it!
$C1920_MAIN_2300_0150_00_skm,Go!
$C1920_MAIN_2300_0160_00_skm,"Team A, Team B, split up!<br>Find Avalanche!"
$C1920_MAIN_2300_0170_00_skm,Move out!
$C1920_MAIN_2300_0200_00_art,Are they looking for us?
$C1920_MAIN_2300_0300_00_cld,Most likely.
$C1920_MAIN_2600_0100_00_brd,"Ah, there you are."
$C1920_MAIN_2600_0200_00_brd,There's no time to explain. Just get back to the inn.
$C1920_MAIN_2600_0300_00_art,But...
$C1920_MAIN_2600_0400_00_brd,Your friends are safe. Only you two remain.
$C1920_MAIN_2600_0500_00_brd,Don't even think about fighting. You'll drag the whole town into it.
$C1920_MAIN_2600_0600_00_art,Let's get out of here.
$C1920_MAIN_2700_0100_00_brd,Come with me.
$C1920_MAIN_2700_0200_00_brd,Let's go through the alley.
$C1920_MAIN_2800_0100_00_brd,Where are you heading?
$C1920_MAIN_2800_0200_00_brd,What are you up to?
$C1920_MAIN_2805_0100_00_mma,"You never know what you'll face out there, so make sure you're well prepared."
$C1920_MAIN_2805_0200_00_mma,Stay safe out there.
$C1920_MAIN_2810_0100_00_skm,All clear.
$C1920_MAIN_2810_0200_00_skm,"Tch, where are they hiding?"
$C1920_MAIN_2810_0300_00_skm,Hey! You there! Seen anyone suspicious?
$C1920_MAIN_2810_0400_00_mfa,"No, I haven't seen anything..."
$C1920_MAIN_2810_0500_00_skm,"Has anyone else spotted a suspicious person? If you do, report it immediately!"
$C1920_MAIN_2820_0100_00_skm,Have they still not been found? Hurry up!
$C1920_MAIN_2820_0200_00_skm,"Yes, sir!"
$C1920_MAIN_2830_0100_00_skm,"Why did you run away, you coward?"
$C1920_MAIN_2830_0200_00_mma,I was just being chased...
$C1920_MAIN_2830_0300_00_skm,You're suspicious. What are you hiding?
$C1920_MAIN_2840_0100_00_skm,We're currently searching the premises!
$C1920_MAIN_2840_0200_00_skm,No entry allowed!
$C1920_MAIN_2850_0100_00_skm,"Sorry, but we need you to cooperate."
$C1920_MAIN_2850_0200_00_mfa,What's going on all of a sudden?
$C1920_MAIN_2850_0300_00_skm,"Just show me your ID, and don't give me any lip!"
$C1920_MAIN_2900_0100_00_brd,"You guys were responsible for the reactor bombings in Midgar, weren't you?"
$C1920_MAIN_2900_0300_00_brd,"Don't worry, I'm on your side. I've got contacts within the main branch."
$C1920_MAIN_2900_0400_00_cld,Are you with Avalanche too?
$C1920_MAIN_2900_0500_00_brd,Something like that.
$C1920_MAIN_3000_0100_00_brd,Wait!
$C1920_MAIN_3000_0200_00_brd,I'll divert the soldiers' attention.
$C1920_MAIN_3000_0210_00_brd,You two use the upper platform to cross.
$C1920_MAIN_3100_0100_00_brd,May I ask what's happening here?
$C1920_MAIN_3100_0200_00_skm,We're in the middle of a manhunt.
$C1920_MAIN_3100_0300_00_skm,Have you seen anyone out of the ordinary?
$C1920_MAIN_3100_0400_00_brd,"Now that you mention it, I think I might have seen someone..."
$C1920_MAIN_3100_0410_00_brd,"But wait, maybe I was mistaken... or was I?"
$C1920_MAIN_3100_0500_00_skm,Enough! Go home!
$C1920_MAIN_3100_0600_00_brd,"Hold on, please! I'm sure I've seen someone suspicious... let me just try to remember..."
$C1920_MAIN_3100_0700_00_skm,Stop interfering and get lost!
$C1920_MAIN_3110_0100_00_skm,Have you found Avalanche yet?
$C1920_MAIN_3110_0200_00_skm,We're still systematically searching the buildings.
$C1920_MAIN_3110_0300_00_skm,Hurry up! Don't let a single rat escape!
$C1920_MAIN_3200_0100_00_brd,That went smoothly.
$C1920_MAIN_3200_0110_00_brd,Almost at the inn. Stay sharp.
$C1920_MAIN_3400_0100_00_art,Where is everyone?
$C1920_MAIN_3400_0200_00_brd,They're waiting downstairs.
$C1920_MAIN_3400_0300_00_brd,The tunnel below the house goes out past the town limits. You should be able to avoid any ambushes if you leave now.
$C1920_MAIN_3400_0400_00_brd,"Once outside, head to a nearby farm. A friend of mine is there and he can help you."
$C1920_MAIN_3400_0500_00_brd,And...
$C1920_MAIN_3400_0600_00_brd,Take this.
$C1920_MAIN_3400_0700_00_brd,It's a crafting device.
$C1920_MAIN_3400_0800_00_brd,An antique from the Republic era. It allows you to craft items from raw materials.
$C1920_MAIN_3400_0900_00_brd,You might find it more useful than I ever did.
$C1920_MAIN_3400_1000_00_cld,You're letting us go. What about you? Will you be alright?
$C1920_MAIN_3400_1100_00_brd,Me and this town... we've got a complicated past with Shinra.
$C1920_MAIN_3400_1110_00_brd,"Honestly, I'm not sure if this is the right path."
$C1920_MAIN_3400_1200_00_brd,Better get moving before I change my mind.
$C1920_MAIN_3400_1300_00_sys,Would you like to view the item crafting tutorial?
$C1920_MAIN_3400_1400_00_sys,Yes
$C1920_MAIN_3400_1500_00_sys,No
$C1920_MAIN_3500_0100_00_brd,Urng...
$C1920_MAIN_3500_0200_00_brd,Cough! Cough! Hrng... Hahh...
$C1920_MAIN_3600_0100_00_brd,"For now, it's best if you steer clear of this town."
$C1920_MAIN_3600_0110_00_brd,I'll notify my contact at the farm.<br>Be sure to drop by.
$C1920_MAIN_3600_0200_00_brd,Wishing you the best of luck.
$C1920_MAIN_3700_0100_00_tif,You made it through safely!
$C1920_MAIN_3700_0200_00_art,Sorry we're late!
$C1920_MAIN_3700_0300_00_blt,"For crying out loud, what were you two up to?"
$C1920_MAIN_3700_0400_00_art,Maybe something like a date?
$C1920_MAIN_3700_0500_00_blt,"Well, no more of that for a while."
$C1920_MAIN_3700_0510_00_blt,Got it!?
$C1920_MAIN_3700_0600_00_blt,"Alright, let’s get out of here."
$C1920_MAIN_3900_0100_00_tif,Is this a dead end?
$C1920_MAIN_3900_0200_00_red,I feel a breeze. This way.
$C1920_MAIN_3900_0300_00_blt,Guess it's my turn.
$C1920_MAIN_4100_0100_00_art,Wow...
$C1920_MAIN_4100_0200_00_art,Just look at it all...
$C1920_MAIN_4100_0300_00_art,It's so alive.
$C1920_MAIN_4100_0310_00_art,"...A living, breathing planet."
$C1920_MAIN_4100_0400_00_art,It seems so much stronger than me.
$C1920_MAIN_4100_0500_00_red,It may look that way.
$C1920_MAIN_4100_0510_00_red,But people can't see the signs of its imminent collapse.
$C1920_MAIN_4100_0600_00_art,There's still so much to learn.
$C1920_MAIN_4100_0700_00_blt,Whaddya wanna know?
$C1920_MAIN_4100_0800_00_art,Hmm... For starters...
$C1920_MAIN_4100_0810_00_art,How do we navigate through this wilderness?
$C1920_MAIN_4100_0900_00_blt,That's a piece of cake.
$C1920_MAIN_4100_0910_00_blt,We do it my way.
$C1920_MAIN_4100_1000_00_blt,Just start walkin'!
$C1920_MAIN_4100_1000_05_blt,"Left, right, left, right..."
$C1920_MAIN_4100_1200_00_tif,Looks like we won't be back to Calm for a while.
$C1920_MAIN_4100_1310_00_cld,"Yeah, seems that way."
$C1920_MAIN_4100_1400_00_cld,Let's move.
$C1920_MAIN_4100_1500_00_art,"This is the real beginning of our journey, right?"
$C1920_MAIN_4100_1500_02_tif,Right.
$C1920_MAIN_4100_1500_05_blt,'Course we are.
$C1920_MAIN_4100_1600_00_blt,Right?
$C1920_MAIN_4100_1700_00_red,Follow me.
$C1920_MAIN_4100_1800_00_blt,Alright!
$C1920_MAIN_4100_1810_00_blt,"Let's get this show on the road, people!"
$C2010_MAIN_0100_0100_00_blt,Do you know what that big pipe is for?
$C2010_MAIN_0100_0200_00_cld,It's a mako pipeline.
$C2010_MAIN_0100_0300_00_cld,It's for transporting mako pumped up in Midgar to other towns.
$C2010_MAIN_0100_0400_00_blt,What flows through that pipe is the lifeblood of the planet. It shouldn’t be used to make money.
$C2010_MAIN_0100_0500_00_blt,"Someday, I'll put an end to that."
$C2010_MAIN_0100_0600_00_blt,"Oh, I got it!"
$C2010_MAIN_0100_0700_00_blt,"How about we bend the pipe and shove it into the ground? That way, we're really giving back to the planet!"
$C2010_MAIN_0100_0800_00_red,That's a brilliant idea.
$C2010_MAIN_0100_0900_00_cld,"Yeah, brilliant."
$C2010_MAIN_0100_1000_00_art,Maybe not a bad idea?
$C2010_MAIN_0100_1100_00_tif,I'll keep that in mind.
$C2010_MAIN_0100_1200_00_blt,"Hey, you guys!"
$C2010_MAIN_0200_0100_00_art,This road's all cracked up.
$C2010_MAIN_0200_0200_00_red,"This is an old road from the republic era. Without maintenance, it's bound to end up like this."
$C2010_MAIN_0200_0300_00_blt,Shinra only takes care of what they use themselves.
$C2010_MAIN_0200_0400_00_tif,I heard that buses used to run along here before.
$C2010_MAIN_0200_0500_00_red,Buses disappeared along with the republic.
$C2010_MAIN_0200_0600_00_blt,"In other words, we're stuck walking 'cause Shinra's too cheap."
$C2010_MAIN_0200_0700_00_art,But it's fun! Isn't this what hiking is like?
$C2010_MAIN_0200_0800_00_cld,It's all about how you look at it.
$C2010_MAIN_0300_0100_00_tif,A Shinra weapon?
$C2010_MAIN_0300_0200_00_cld,"Yeah, but it's definitely an older model."
$C2010_MAIN_0300_0300_00_blt,"Probably from when they were fighting the republic, right?"
$C2010_MAIN_0300_0400_00_art,Hard to believe there was a war here.
$C2010_MAIN_0300_0500_00_blt,This planet's history is just one war after another.
$C2010_MAIN_0400_0100_00_tif,Are those monsters? Or animals?
$C2010_MAIN_0400_0200_00_cld,They're animals.
$C2010_MAIN_0400_0300_00_art,How can you tell?
$C2010_MAIN_0400_0400_00_cld,One of the basics for a SOLDIER is to know this stuff from field guides.
$C2010_MAIN_0400_0500_00_red,"Animals attack for food or to protect their territory. Monsters, on the other hand, attack without any reason."
$C2010_MAIN_0400_0600_00_cld,Knowing that won't help if we get attacked first.
$C2010_MAIN_0400_0700_00_red,"In this case, I don't smell any danger from them. You need to train your nose better."
$C2010_MAIN_0500_0100_00_blt,Still got Shinra goons crawling around.
$C2010_MAIN_0500_0200_00_red,It's best if we stay away for now.
$C2010_MAIN_0500_0300_00_tif,Do you think they're looking for us?
$C2010_MAIN_0500_0400_00_art,Sorry for causing so much trouble.
$C2010_MAIN_0600_0100_00_blt,We risk getting caught if we go now.
$C2010_MAIN_0600_0200_00_red,We should stay away while Shinra is around.
$C2010_MAIN_0600_0300_00_tif,It's probably best to wait for now.
$C2010_MAIN_0600_0400_00_art,"Shinra's here, I can feel it."
$C2010_MAIN_0700_0100_00_olv,"You folks are from Avalanche, right?"
$C2010_MAIN_0700_0110_00_olv,"Don't worry, I got word from the inn in Kalm."
$C2010_MAIN_0700_0300_00_olv,It's said that Shinra is seriously hunting you down. This place might not be safe either.
$C2010_MAIN_0700_0500_00_olv,There's an old dock near the swamp. It might be a good place to hide.
$C2010_MAIN_0700_0600_00_olv,"Sorry, I can't hide you here. I recommend the dock by the swamp if you need to lay low."
$C2010_MAIN_0700_0700_00_olv,Monsters have been increasing recently. You guys be careful out there.
$C2010_MAIN_0900_0100_00_gro,"Well, well! If it isn't my favorite group of hitchhikers!"
$C2010_MAIN_0900_0210_00_art,"Fancy meeting you here, mister truck driver!"
$C2010_MAIN_0900_0300_00_tif,Thanks again for giving us a lift to Kalm.
$C2010_MAIN_0900_0400_00_gro,"Oh, don't mention it. It's always a pleasure for such charming young ladies."
$C2010_MAIN_0900_0500_00_gro,"Oh, I almost forgot to introduce myself."
$C2010_MAIN_0900_0510_00_gro,Name's Bill. You can count on me for a ride anytime.
$C2010_MAIN_0900_0600_00_gro,"Unfortunately, my truck's not in the best shape today. I can't give you a ride."
$C2010_MAIN_0900_0700_00_art,"That's alright, we're enjoying the fresh air today. Thanks though."
$C2010_MAIN_0900_0800_00_cld,Know of any place around here that's a bit more secluded?
$C2010_MAIN_0900_0900_00_gro,"Secluded, huh?"
$C2010_MAIN_0900_1010_00_gro,"Well, when you're young, it's easy to get swept up in your passions."
$C2010_MAIN_0900_1100_00_gro,"That's right. If you head to the dock in the wetlands, it's quiet and secluded. Absolutely perfect."
$C2010_MAIN_1000_0100_00_gro,Swing by the ranch later if you've got the time.
$C2010_MAIN_1000_0200_00_gro,I'm tied up right now. Sorry about that.
$C2010_MAIN_1000_0300_00_gro,"Dang it, just as we're near the ranch, this old piece of junk!"
$C2010_MAIN_1300_0100_00_blt,No sign of Shinra.
$C2010_MAIN_1300_0200_00_cld,Yeah.
$C2010_MAIN_1300_0300_00_red,Looks like an old republic landing.
$C2010_MAIN_1300_0400_00_blt,Used to cross the wetlands by boat back in the day.
$C2010_MAIN_1300_0410_00_blt,"After that, we head through the Mithril Mine to Junon."
$C2010_MAIN_1300_0500_00_cld,"Yeah, that's right."
$C2010_MAIN_1300_0600_00_red,But the boats are in no condition to sail.
$C2010_MAIN_1300_0700_00_art,Should we give it a try?
$C2010_MAIN_1300_0800_00_cld,No way.
$C2010_MAIN_1300_0900_00_blt,Then we swim!
$C2010_MAIN_1300_1000_00_tif,These swamps are home to the dangerous Midgardsormr.
$C2010_MAIN_1300_1010_00_tif,...So be careful.
$C2010_MAIN_1300_1100_00_art,"But if we rent a chocobo, we should be okay."
$C2010_MAIN_1300_1110_00_art,"Come on, let's cross the swamp on a chocobo."
$C2010_MAIN_1300_1200_00_tif,You can get a chocobo at the Green Ranch.
$C2010_MAIN_1300_1300_00_tif,Let's go!
$C2010_MAIN_1300_1400_00_art,What do you think?
$C2010_MAIN_1300_1410_00_art,Do we rent some chocobos?
$C2010_MAIN_1300_1500_00_tif,Should we?
$C2010_MAIN_1300_1600_00_cld,Let's go.
$C2010_MAIN_1600_0100_00_blt,Aren't we taking chocobos?
$C2010_MAIN_1600_0200_00_red,It's too dangerous to go on foot.
$C2010_MAIN_1600_0300_00_tif,We need to get chocobos first.
$C2010_MAIN_1600_0400_00_art,Aren't we riding chocobos?
$C2010_MAIN_1700_0100_00_gro,"Well, well! If it isn't my favorite group of hitchhikers!"
$C2010_MAIN_1700_0210_00_art,Fancy meeting you here!
$C2010_MAIN_1700_0300_00_tif,Thanks again for the ride to Kalm.
$C2010_MAIN_1700_0400_00_gro,"Ah, don't mention it. It's the least I could do for such lovely young ladies."
$C2010_MAIN_1700_0500_00_gro,But I do believe I neglected to introduce myself.
$C2010_MAIN_1700_0510_00_gro,"The name's Bill, and you can count on me for a lift anytime."
$C2010_MAIN_1700_0600_00_gro,Pleasure to see y'all again. And welcome to my humble ranch.
$C2010_MAIN_1700_0700_00_art,Managed to get your truck fixed?
$C2010_MAIN_1700_0800_00_gro,Indeed I did. You must've been my lucky charms. She started up right after you left.
$C2010_MAIN_1700_0900_00_gro,"Anyway, what can I do for you today? You looking for some Chocobos by any chance?"
$C2010_MAIN_1700_1000_00_blt,You bet. We need them to cross the swamps.
$C2010_MAIN_1700_1100_00_gro,You've come to the right place!
$C2010_MAIN_1700_1200_00_gro,"We used to have a government-run transit system, but as you know, it's completely useless now."
$C2010_MAIN_1700_1300_00_gro,That's where chocobos come in handy!
$C2010_MAIN_1700_1400_00_gro,Especially useful in the swamplands.
$C2010_MAIN_1700_1500_00_gro,Ladies...
$C2010_MAIN_1700_1510_00_gro,Do you know how chocobos manage to cross those bottomless swamps?
$C2010_MAIN_1700_1600_00_tif,Uh...
$C2010_MAIN_1700_1700_00_art,Uh...
$C2010_MAIN_1700_1800_00_gro,"Believe it or not, their fluffy feathers keep them afloat while their strong legs effortlessly swim across!"
$C2010_MAIN_1700_1900_00_gro,Not even the dreaded Midgardsormr can catch up to a chocobo.
$C2010_MAIN_1700_2000_00_gro,"So what I'm saying is,"
$C2010_MAIN_1700_2010_00_gro,Chocobos are your best bet for crossing the marshland!
$C2010_MAIN_1700_2100_00_gro,Absolutely no doubt about it.
$C2010_MAIN_1700_2200_00_cld,Can we rent one here?
$C2010_MAIN_1700_2300_00_gro,Of course.
$C2010_MAIN_1700_2400_00_gro,"Ask my grandson, Billy, in the stable over there for more details."
$C2010_MAIN_1800_0100_00_gro,Hmm? Got a question?
$C2010_MAIN_1800_0110_00_sys,Is there something you need to ask?
$C2010_MAIN_1800_0120_00_sys,Tell me about Midgardsormr.
$C2010_MAIN_1800_0130_00_sys,I'd like to know about chocobos.
$C2010_MAIN_1800_0140_00_sys,"No, nothing right now."
$C2010_MAIN_1800_0200_00_gro,"Ah, that would be the serpent dwelling in the wetlands. It's a gargantuan snake, over 10 meters in length."
$C2010_MAIN_1800_0300_00_gro,It silently sneaks up on any humans or animals that enter the swamps and attacks swiftly. Just thinking about it gives me the chills.
$C2010_MAIN_1800_0400_00_gro,But even creatures like that can't keep up with the speed of a chocobo.
$C2010_MAIN_1800_0410_00_gro,That's a piece of trivia any seasoned traveler would know.
$C2010_MAIN_1800_0500_00_gro,"You look like the type who'd know that, judging by that sword of yours."
$C2010_MAIN_1800_0700_00_gro,'Course ya have.
$C2010_MAIN_1800_0800_00_gro,I'm confident in my ability to judge both chocobos and people.
$C2010_MAIN_1800_0900_00_gro,Midgardsormr is a monstrous serpent that lives in the wetlands.
$C2010_MAIN_1800_1000_00_gro,"To avoid getting attacked by them, traveling by chocobo is your best bet."
$C2010_MAIN_1800_1100_00_gro,"For more details, talk to Gringrin over at the Chocobo stable."
$C2010_MAIN_1900_0100_00_gro,"Oh, I hear you're gonna catch that runaway chocobo for us? We're counting on you!"
$C2010_MAIN_1900_0200_00_gro,Better check the signs while the truck's still running smoothly.
$C2010_MAIN_1900_0300_00_gro,I heard Shinra's military has Kalm on lockdown. Do you guys know anything about that?
$C2010_MAIN_2000_0100_00_grb,Howdy!
$C2010_MAIN_2000_0200_00_cld,Saw the sign. Need some chocobos to cross the swamp.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_0300_00_grb,"Um, sorry, pops, but you're outta luck."
$C2010_MAIN_2000_0400_00_cld,"""Pops""?"
$C2010_MAIN_2000_0500_00_grb,Got no more birds. Last one went this morning.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_0600_00_blt,"Coulda fooled me, kid."
$C2010_MAIN_2000_0700_00_grb,These're spoken for. That or they're not fit for riding.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_0800_00_grb,But...
$C2010_MAIN_2000_0810_00_grb,"I can see you're in a bind, so I'll bump you up the list─for a price, of course."
$C2010_MAIN_2000_0900_00_blt,Which is?
$C2010_MAIN_2000_1000_00_grb,Over ten thousand.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_1100_00_art,I'm sorry.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_1110_00_art,We can't pay that much while we're traveling.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_1300_00_grb,But I have a good tip for you.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_1400_00_grb,It'll cost you a thousand gil.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_1410_00_grb,...That's what some might say.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_1420_00_grb,"But I wouldn't want to trouble a lovely lady like you, so it's free."
$C2010_MAIN_2000_1500_00_grb,"Actually, one of our chocobos ran away from the farm<br>and turned wild a little while ago."
$C2010_MAIN_2000_1600_00_grb,"If you can catch it, it's yours free of charge."
$C2010_MAIN_2000_1700_00_art,Really?
$C2010_MAIN_2000_1800_00_grb,Name's Piko.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_1810_00_grb,He's a bit of a handful and managed to escape while grazing.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_1900_00_grb,He kinda reminds me of pops here.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_2200_00_grb,"First, look for Piko's tracks."
$C2010_MAIN_2000_2210_00_grb,"If you find tracks, he should be nearby."
$C2010_MAIN_2000_2300_00_grb,Wild chocobos can be really cautious around people.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_2400_00_grb,"But if you approach quietly enough, even you could catch him."
$C2010_MAIN_2000_2500_00_art,Got it. Thanks.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_2600_00_grb,And one more thing.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_2610_00_grb,"I'm giving you this intel for free, so make sure you buy something from our shop."
$C2010_MAIN_2000_2700_00_grb,Speak to Chloe over there. She can sell you whatever you need.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_2810_00_blt,The kid's got a knack for business.
$C2010_MAIN_2000_2900_00_grb,If y'all can catch our runaway and bring him back here...
$C2010_MAIN_2000_3000_00_grb,"I'll teach you how to ride and care for him, free of charge."
$C2010_MAIN_2050_0100_00_grb,Have you checked out the shop yet?
$C2010_MAIN_2050_0200_00_grb,"Even if you're broke, just take a look."
$C2010_MAIN_2100_0100_00_grb,Got a question 'bout chocobos?
$C2010_MAIN_2100_0110_00_sys,Got a question 'bout chocobos?
$C2010_MAIN_2100_0120_00_sys,Where can I find chocobos?
$C2010_MAIN_2100_0130_00_sys,How do I catch a chocobo?
$C2010_MAIN_2100_0140_00_sys,Can you tell me about the gear?
$C2010_MAIN_2100_0150_00_sys,No questions.
$C2010_MAIN_2100_0200_00_grb,"Once you're outside, look for chocobo tracks. They'll be nearby, for sure."
$C2010_MAIN_2100_0300_00_grb,Wild chocobos are a lot more cautious.
$C2010_MAIN_2100_0310_00_grb,"The trick is to sneak up on 'em quietly, so they don't notice."
$C2010_MAIN_2100_0400_00_grb,"Take good care of Piko for me, alright?"
$C2010_MAIN_2100_0500_00_grb,"By equipping Chocobos with gear, you can not only make them look cool but also boost their racing abilities."
$C2010_MAIN_2100_0600_00_grb,"We trade in golden plumes, so don't forget to collect those too."
$C2010_MAIN_2200_0100_00_krn,I'm sorry my brother keeps talking about money.
$C2010_MAIN_2200_0200_00_art,It's his job. Don't worry about it.
$C2010_MAIN_2200_0300_00_krn,"I know, but ever since our parents... he's become really strict about money."
$C2010_MAIN_2200_0400_00_krn,"By the way, are you from Midgar?"
$C2010_MAIN_2200_0500_00_art,"Yeah, from the slums."
$C2010_MAIN_2200_0600_00_krn,Do you know Chocobo Sam?
$C2010_MAIN_2200_0700_00_art,Well... we know of him.
$C2010_MAIN_2200_0800_00_krn,Where can I find him?
$C2010_MAIN_2200_0900_00_cld,Probably in Sector 6 slums.
$C2010_MAIN_2200_0910_00_cld,He's a big shot in Wall─
$C2010_MAIN_2200_1000_00_art,Um...do you want to see Sam?
$C2010_MAIN_2200_1100_00_krn,"Hmm, I'm not sure."
$C2010_MAIN_2200_1110_00_krn,He's the one responsible for what happened to Mom and Dad.
$C2010_MAIN_2200_1200_00_grb,"Chloe, that's not something we should tell our guests."
$C2010_MAIN_2200_1300_00_krn,But...
$C2010_MAIN_2200_1400_00_grb,Please don't mention this to anyone.
$C2010_MAIN_2200_1500_00_grb,"Sam is a big shot in the Chocobo business. If any rumors start circulating, our ranch will be in trouble."
$C2010_MAIN_2200_1600_00_art,Got it. We won't tell a soul.
$C2010_MAIN_2200_1700_00_krn,"If you catch Piko, try giving him these greens."
$C2010_MAIN_2200_1800_00_krn,"Piko loves vegetables, so he might come back if you offer him these."
$C2010_MAIN_2200_1900_00_krn,"Well then, feel free to browse through our store."
$C2010_MAIN_2200_2000_00_krn,"My brother insists you have to buy something, but just take a look and purchase what you like."
$C2010_MAIN_2200_2100_00_krn,And we're also trading chocobo gear for golden feathers.
$C2010_MAIN_2200_2200_00_krn,So please don't forget to trade them in if you have any!
$C2010_MAIN_2200_2300_00_krn,Please take care of Piko for us!
$C2010_MAIN_2300_0100_00_krn,Trust us for everything chocobo-related!
$C2010_MAIN_2300_0200_00_krn,Welcome to our store!
$C2010_MAIN_2300_0300_00_krn,What can we do for you today?
$C2010_MAIN_2300_0400_00_krn,Thanks for visiting!
$C2010_MAIN_2300_0500_00_krn,Please come again soon!
$C2010_MAIN_2300_0600_00_krn,You're always welcome here!
$C2010_MAIN_2300_0700_00_krn,"When you want to change your chocobo's outfit, use the 'Choco Room' over there."
$C2010_MAIN_2400_0100_00_blt,"Alright, let's go find that chocobo!"
$C2010_MAIN_2400_0200_00_art,Its name is Piko!
$C2010_MAIN_2400_0300_00_tif,"First, we should look for tracks."
$C2010_MAIN_2600_0100_00_cld,There it is.
$C2010_MAIN_2600_0200_00_blt,Alright! Now all we gotta do is catch it.
$C2010_MAIN_2600_0300_00_cld,Stay quiet. The key to hunting is not alerting your target.
$C2010_MAIN_2600_0400_00_art,Hunting? We're supposed to make friends with it.
$C2010_MAIN_2600_0500_00_cld,Yeah…
$C2010_MAIN_2700_0100_00_ch1,Kweh!
$C2010_MAIN_2700_0200_00_art,"Aw, isn't he just the cutest?"
$C2010_MAIN_2700_0300_00_art,"You know, they are kinda similar!"
$C2010_MAIN_2700_0400_00_tif,Totally!
$C2010_MAIN_2700_0500_00_blt,What does he want now?
$C2010_MAIN_2700_0600_00_art,Do you think maybe he's still hungry?
$C2010_MAIN_2700_0700_00_tif,Sorry... That's all the food we had.
$C2010_MAIN_2700_0800_00_ch1,Kweh...
$C2010_MAIN_2700_0900_00_art,But you know where there's more? Bill's place!
$C2010_MAIN_2700_1000_00_ch1,Kweh!
$C2010_MAIN_2700_1100_00_red,Looks like we're heading back to the ranch.
$C2010_MAIN_2700_1200_00_art,Let's go after them!
$C2010_MAIN_2900_0100_00_art,"Ah, there you are!"
$C2010_MAIN_2900_0200_00_art,Did the veggies remind you of home?
$C2010_MAIN_2900_0300_00_grb,Not a scratch on him.
$C2010_MAIN_2900_0310_00_grb,"In fact, he's looking stronger."
$C2010_MAIN_2900_0400_00_cld,Think we can ride him?
$C2010_MAIN_2900_0500_00_grb,Not right now. He's too hungry to cooperate.
$C2010_MAIN_2900_0600_00_grb,"But once he's eaten and calmed down, it should be fine."
$C2010_MAIN_2900_0700_00_grb,"I'll get him prepped for riding, so just wait outside for a bit."
$C2010_MAIN_3000_0100_00_grb,"Piko gets nervous around strangers, so could you wait outside?"
$C2010_MAIN_3000_0200_00_grb,It might take a little longer. Could you wait outside?
$C2010_MAIN_3100_0100_00_krn,I can't express how grateful I am that you brought Piko back.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0100_00_chd,"Hey, Cloud!"
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0200_00_cld,You are...
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0300_00_chd,"It's me, Chadley!"
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0400_00_chd,Huh...did you forget about me?
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0410_00_sys,Did you forget about me?
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0420_00_sys,I don't remember.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0430_00_sys,Of course I remember.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0500_00_cld,Sorry.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0600_00_chd,Oh...really?
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0610_00_chd,"So I'm just that insignificant to you, Cloud?"
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0620_00_chd,That's unfortunate.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0700_00_chd,"Well then, let me introduce myself again."
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0710_00_chd,My name is Chadley.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0800_00_chd,I was researching materia in Midgar.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_0900_00_chd,"We met in the slums, and I asked you to submit battle reports for my research."
$C2010_MAIN_3200_1000_00_chd,"We spoke several times in Midgar, and you were very helpful."
$C2010_MAIN_3200_1100_00_chd,"So, do you remember me a little?"
$C2010_MAIN_3200_1200_00_cld,Yeah.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_1300_00_chd,"Great, I'm so glad!"
$C2010_MAIN_3200_1400_00_chd,I'm so happy!
$C2010_MAIN_3200_1500_00_chd,Thank you for all the battle reports you submitted in Midgar.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_1600_00_chd,"Thanks to you, I was able to create so much materia."
$C2010_MAIN_3200_1700_00_chd,Detecting confusion... 'Why the heck is he here?'
$C2010_MAIN_3200_1810_00_chd,"I was created by Professor Hojo, you know."
$C2010_MAIN_3200_1820_00_chd,Reading your emotions is a piece of cake for me.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_1900_00_chd,"Actually, I followed your example and left Midgar too."
$C2010_MAIN_3200_2000_00_chd,Now I'm exploring the entire world.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_2100_00_chd,"So, there's something I'd like to ask you, Cloud."
$C2010_MAIN_3200_2200_00_cld,You need more battle data?
$C2010_MAIN_3200_2300_00_chd,That's the Cloud I know. Straight to the point.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_2310_00_chd,"But before that, I need you to activate the communication towers."
$C2010_MAIN_3200_2400_00_chd,"The Republic of Junon originally built these communication towers worldwide, but Shinra took them over."
$C2010_MAIN_3200_2500_00_chd,They've been abandoned and unused since then.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_2510_00_chd,"So I thought, why not put them to good use?"
$C2010_MAIN_3200_2600_00_chd,"Every time you activate a tower, my processing power increases..."
$C2010_MAIN_3200_2700_00_chd,and I can expand my area of exploration.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_2800_00_chd,I might even be able to set up a communications network that Shinra can't interfere with.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_2900_00_chd,What do you say? I think this could benefit you and your team as well.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_3000_00_cld,"If we find any, we'll activate them."
$C2010_MAIN_3200_3100_00_chd,"I knew I could count on you, Cloud."
$C2010_MAIN_3200_3200_00_chd,Let's get started right away. Please activate the communications tower over there.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_3300_00_chd,Here's the activation module.
$C2010_MAIN_3200_3400_00_chd,I'll guide you this time since it’s close by.
$C2010_MAIN_3700_0100_00_chd,"Hey, Cloud! This way!"
$C2010_MAIN_3700_0200_00_chd,Make sure to stay close!
$C2010_MAIN_3800_0100_00_chd,Here we are.
$C2010_MAIN_3800_0200_00_chd,Tower activation confirmed.
$C2010_MAIN_3800_0300_00_chd,Initiating preliminary scan of the grasslands.
$C2010_MAIN_3800_0400_00_chd,I'll ascertain the locations of monsters<br>and gatherable materials.
$C2010_MAIN_4100_0110_00_gro,"Lemme guess. Y'all are headed for the swamplands, aren't ya?"
$C2010_MAIN_4100_0200_00_art,"Yeah, that's what we're planning."
$C2010_MAIN_4100_0400_00_gro,"Just a little while ago, while I was checking the signs..."
$C2010_MAIN_4100_0500_00_gro,"I saw a group in black robes wanderin' into the swamplands, lookin' like a funeral procession."
$C2010_MAIN_4100_0600_00_cld,Black robes?
$C2010_MAIN_4100_0700_00_gro,"Yep, I told 'em it was dangerous without chocobos, but they just went on ahead."
$C2010_MAIN_4100_0800_00_gro,"At this rate, they'll end up as Midgardsormr's lunch."
$C2010_MAIN_4100_0900_00_gro,"If you spot 'em, can you try to get 'em to drop by my place?"
$C2010_MAIN_4200_0200_00_gro,"There's an old friend of mine who runs a chocobo ranch near Junon. If you have some time, drop by and visit him."
$C2010_MAIN_4200_0300_00_gro,"The moment you hop on a chocobo, the world suddenly opens up!"
$C2010_MAIN_4600_0100_00_red,"If we're going to cross the swamp, it’s best to summon some chocobos."
$C2010_MAIN_4700_0100_00_blt,"We can actually cross this, right?"
$C2010_MAIN_4700_0200_00_blt,I've heard there are bottomless swamps and giant snake monsters here.
$C2010_MAIN_4700_0300_00_tif,Bill said the chocobos would be fine.
$C2010_MAIN_4700_0400_00_art,Let's trust these little guys.
$C2010_MAIN_4700_0500_00_ch1,Kweh!
$C2010_MAIN_4800_0100_00_cld,Look over there
$C2010_MAIN_4800_0200_00_cld,It's Sephiroth
$C2010_MAIN_4800_0300_00_tif,Really?
$C2010_MAIN_4800_0400_00_cld,Let's go
$C2010_MAIN_4800_0500_00_blt,I don't see Sephiroth anywhere
$C2010_MAIN_4800_0600_00_tif,"Yeah, me neither..."
$C2010_MAIN_4900_0100_00_art,The goal is in sight!
$C2010_MAIN_4900_0200_00_cld,Let's hurry.
$C2010_MAIN_4900_0400_00_blt,"Hey, what's going on!?"
$C2010_MAIN_4900_0500_00_tif,What is that!?
$C2010_MAIN_4900_0800_00_blt,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!"
$C2010_MAIN_4900_0900_00_red,It seems it camouflaged itself as an island.
$C2010_MAIN_4900_1000_00_blt,Thanks for the heads up.
$C2010_MAIN_4900_1100_00_cld,Here it comes!
$C2010_MAIN_4910_0200_00_cld,Get away!
$C2010_MAIN_5000_0100_00_art,Is it gone?
$C2010_MAIN_5000_0600_00_tif,Cloud!
$C2010_MAIN_5000_0700_00_art,No...
$C2010_MAIN_5200_0100_00_art,Rise and shine!
$C2010_MAIN_5200_0200_00_art,Do you recognize me?
$C2010_MAIN_5200_0300_00_cld,Aerith...
$C2010_MAIN_5200_0400_00_art,"Welcome back, Cloud."
$C2010_MAIN_5200_0500_00_cld,What about Sephiroth?
$C2010_MAIN_5200_0600_00_cld,Sephiroth really is strong...
$C2010_MAIN_5200_0700_00_cld,Those guys might be chasing after Sephiroth too.
$C2010_MAIN_5200_0800_00_art,"Yeah, I get that feeling too."
$C2010_MAIN_5200_0900_00_cld,Let's go after them.
$C2110_MAIN_0100_0100_00_red,Is Sephiroth here?
$C2110_MAIN_0100_0200_00_cld,I don't know.
$C2110_MAIN_0100_0300_00_art,There might be monsters.
$C2110_MAIN_0100_0400_00_tif,Undoubtedly.
$C2110_MAIN_0100_0500_00_cld,We can handle the small fry. Just don't go chasing after them.
$C2110_MAIN_0100_0600_00_art,That's easy for you to say.
$C2110_MAIN_0100_0610_00_art,They're all tough for me.
$C2110_MAIN_0100_0700_00_tif,Me too.
$C2110_MAIN_0100_0800_00_blt,Same here.
$C2110_MAIN_0100_0810_00_blt,"Cloud, you take the lead."
$C2110_MAIN_0100_0900_00_cld,For two thousand.
$C2110_MAIN_0100_1000_00_art,"Somewhere between 'the best' and 'the usual,' right?"
$C2110_MAIN_0100_1100_00_tif,What are you talking about?
$C2110_MAIN_0100_1200_00_art,A massage!
$C2110_MAIN_0100_1300_00_tif,A massage?
$C2110_MAIN_0100_1400_00_cld,Let's go.
$C2110_MAIN_0100_1410_00_cld,"Keep your guard up, everyone."
$C2110_MAIN_0300_0100_00_art,"Look, it's them!"
$C2110_MAIN_0300_0200_00_red,It looks like they're heading deeper in.
$C2110_MAIN_0300_0300_00_cld,Let's follow them.
$C2110_MAIN_0400_0200_00_tif,I hope they're all right...
$C2110_MAIN_0400_0300_00_cld,Yeah...
$C2110_MAIN_0400_0310_00_cld,But we shouldn't get too involved.
$C2110_MAIN_0400_0400_00_tif,Right...
$C2110_MAIN_0400_0500_00_blt,"Yeah, it's worrying..."
$C2110_MAIN_0400_0510_00_blt,"Okay, I'll go check it out!"
$C2110_MAIN_0400_0600_00_tif,"Alright, I'll go too."
$C2110_MAIN_0400_0700_00_blt,"No, stay here. Navigating this place needs a bit of expertise."
$C2110_MAIN_0400_0800_00_blt,"Sorry, but amateurs would just be a burden."
$C2110_MAIN_0400_0900_00_red,I'll go too.
$C2110_MAIN_0400_0910_00_red,I have some experience in these matters.
$C2110_MAIN_0400_1000_00_tif,Then... please. Sorry to trouble you.
$C2110_MAIN_0400_1100_00_tif,"No, I mean... thank you."
$C2110_MAIN_0400_1200_02_cld,Of course.
$C2110_MAIN_0400_1200_00_blt,"Don't lose sight of the other guys in black, ya hear?"
$C2110_MAIN_0400_1300_00_art,"Take care, everyone!"
$C2110_MAIN_1100_0100_00_art,Wow... This place is huge!
$C2110_MAIN_1100_0200_00_tif,What's that building?
$C2110_MAIN_1100_0300_00_cld,Maybe it connects to the way out.
$C2110_MAIN_1100_0400_00_art,Let's go check it out!
$C2110_MAIN_1450_0100_00_art,Looks like we lost the people in the black robes.
$C2110_MAIN_1450_0200_00_cld,We can still catch up to them.
$C2110_MAIN_1450_0300_00_tif,I hope none of them have fallen again...
$C2110_MAIN_1500_0100_00_eln,"So, how's Reno doing? Holding up okay?"
$C2110_MAIN_1500_0200_00_lud,His injuries aren't too bad.
$C2110_MAIN_1500_0300_00_lud,"He's been working nonstop lately, so he's just taking a little break."
$C2110_MAIN_1500_0400_00_eln,Isn't that what you'd call a dream vacation? A 'vacation'!
$C2110_MAIN_1500_0500_00_lud,"Well, something like that."
$C2110_MAIN_1500_0600_00_eln,I'm so jealous!
$C2110_MAIN_1500_0700_00_lud,"Nah, he's bored out of his mind."
$C2110_MAIN_1500_0800_00_eln,"Yeah, you might be right."
$C2110_MAIN_1500_1000_00_eln,What's up?
$C2110_MAIN_1500_1100_00_lud,It's nothing. Just... keep talking.
$C2110_MAIN_1500_1200_00_eln,"Uh, yes?"
$C2110_MAIN_1610_0300_00_eln,Rude!
$C2110_MAIN_1610_0400_00_lud,Let's do it by the book.
$C2110_MAIN_1610_0500_00_eln,"Yes, sir!"
$C2110_MAIN_1700_0100_00_blt,Hands in the air! Both of them!
$C2110_MAIN_1700_0200_00_blt,Better keep that thing where I can see it...
$C2110_MAIN_1700_0210_00_blt,Don't try anything funny.
$C2110_MAIN_1700_0500_00_blt,Now then...
$C2110_MAIN_1700_0510_00_blt,Let's settle the score for our friends and Sector 7.
$C2110_MAIN_1700_0600_00_tsu,You're blaming the wrong people.
$C2110_MAIN_1700_0700_00_tsu,You're the ones who started this war.
$C2110_MAIN_1700_0800_00_tsu,"Our situation has changed, though."
$C2110_MAIN_1700_0900_00_tsu,"While you are still wanted, we will overlook this if you stay out of our way."
$C2110_MAIN_1700_1000_00_blt,You think you're so high and mighty!
$C2110_MAIN_1700_1100_00_tsu,Take care of Aerith.
$C2110_MAIN_1700_1200_00_tsu,Elena!
$C2110_MAIN_1700_1500_00_blt,Nice one!
$C2110_MAIN_1800_0200_00_red,Can you swim?
$C2110_MAIN_1800_0300_00_blt,Where's Cloud and the others?
$C2110_MAIN_1800_0400_00_tif,Are you alright?
$C2110_MAIN_1800_0500_00_blt,"Oh yeah, feeling refreshed!"
$C2110_MAIN_1800_0600_00_art,Can you get back up?
$C2110_MAIN_1800_0700_00_blt,Leave it to us!
$C2110_MAIN_1800_0800_03_blt,Barret
$C2110_MAIN_1800_0800_00_tif,We'll meet at the exit.
$C2110_MAIN_1800_1100_00_red,I've seen a lot like them before.
$C2110_MAIN_1800_1110_00_red,At Hojo's place.
$C2110_MAIN_1800_1200_00_red,Seems like they're deeply addicted to Mako.
$C2110_MAIN_1800_1300_00_blt,"Damn you, Shinra..."
$C2110_MAIN_1800_1400_00_blt,So what's the deal with them? What are they doing all together?
$C2110_MAIN_1800_1500_00_red,They might be following Sephiroth. That's what Cloud thinks.
$C2110_MAIN_1800_1600_00_blt,"Cloud thinks that, huh..."
$C2110_MAIN_1800_1700_00_blt,You think he's alright?
$C2110_MAIN_1900_0100_00_blt,Alright...how are we getting to the top?
$C2110_MAIN_1900_0200_00_red,We could use those vines.
$C2110_MAIN_2500_0100_00_blt,"Well now, look who it is."
$C2110_MAIN_2500_0200_00_art,"Hey, Barret! Over here!"
$C2110_MAIN_2500_0300_00_blt,What's up? Taking a break?
$C2110_MAIN_2500_0400_00_tif,We can't get across!
$C2110_MAIN_2500_0500_00_cld,Can you set up a path from that side?
$C2110_MAIN_2500_0600_00_blt,Two grand! Two thousand!
$C2110_MAIN_2500_0700_00_cld,"Fine, do what you want."
$C2110_MAIN_2700_0100_00_red,Is there any way we can knock that down?
$C2110_MAIN_3000_0200_00_art,We're in business!
$C2110_MAIN_3000_0300_00_tif,Thanks!
$C2110_MAIN_3000_0400_00_cld,'Preciate it!
$C2110_MAIN_3000_0500_00_blt,Two grand! And don't you forget.
$C2110_MAIN_3100_0100_00_red,Looks like we can't open it from this side.
$C2110_MAIN_3100_0200_00_blt,Can you open it from over there?
$C2110_MAIN_3100_0300_00_art,I'll give it a try.
$C2110_MAIN_3100_0400_00_blt,You saved us!
$C2110_MAIN_3100_0500_00_art,That'll be 2000 gil.
$C2110_MAIN_3100_0600_00_blt,"Oh...uh, sure."
$C2110_MAIN_3200_0100_00_blt,What the?
$C2110_MAIN_3200_0200_00_blt,"Is this nature's power, too?"
$C2110_MAIN_3200_0300_00_red,Seems we woke it up.
$C2110_MAIN_3200_0400_00_blt,Leave the lullaby to Daddy here!
$C2110_MAIN_3300_0100_00_blt,That's some fancy Mithril stairway you got there.
$C2110_MAIN_3500_0000_05_blt,Hey!
$C2110_MAIN_3500_0100_00_cld,What took you so long?
$C2110_MAIN_3500_0200_00_blt,We stumbled upon a giant chunk of mythril and got distracted.
$C2110_MAIN_3500_0210_00_blt,Right?
$C2110_MAIN_3500_0300_00_red,This place could collapse at any time. We should get out of here quickly.
$C2110_MAIN_3500_0400_00_cld,"Yeah, but Shinra knows we're here."
$C2110_MAIN_3500_0500_00_cld,They might have an ambush waiting.
$C2110_MAIN_3500_0600_00_blt,"If I were them, I'd do the same."
$C2110_MAIN_3500_0610_00_blt,"But we gotta go, no matter what."
$C2110_MAIN_3500_0700_00_blt,"After what we've been through in Midgar, we can't turn back now."
$C2110_MAIN_3500_0800_00_blt,Our mission is to protect the planet.
$C2110_MAIN_3500_0900_00_blt,"If Shinra gets in our way, we'll fight them."
$C2110_MAIN_3500_0900_05_cld,Right.
$C2110_MAIN_3500_1000_00_cld,Let's keep tailing the guys in black cloaks. They're probably linked to Sephiroth.
$CHADL_QST_01_0100_0100_00_chd,"Cloud, the Ancient Materia should be nearby."
$CHADL_QST_01_0100_0200_00_chd,Please conduct a thorough search to find anything that looks relevant.
$CHADL_QST_01_0200_0100_00_bon,Hahhh!
$CHADL_QST_01_0200_0200_00_beg,Hyahaha! This one's definitely valuable!
$CHADL_QST_01_0200_0300_00_buc,"Hehehe! Valuable, valuable!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0200_0310_00_buc,"Wait, what does 'valuable' mean?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0200_0400_00_bad,You idiot! 'Valuable' means... you know...
$CHADL_QST_01_0200_0410_00_bad,"It's a treasure, right!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0200_0500_00_beg,That's right! This means we can finally leave our thieving days behind.
$CHADL_QST_01_0200_0510_00_beg,"From now on, we’re not just some thieves. We're Beck's Company!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0200_0600_00_beg,"Alright, everyone, look around and see if there's any more treasure!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0200_0700_00_buc,"Valuable stuff, valuable stuff! I'm on it, Boss!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0200_0800_00_bad,"Treasure, o beautiful treasure!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0200_0900_00_bon,"Sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_0100_00_beg,Huh?
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_0110_00_beg,Oh shit!
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_0200_00_bad,Oh shit!
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_0300_00_buc,Oh shit!
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_0400_00_bon,Doh shur!
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_0500_00_beg,Th-the hell <i>you</i> people doin' here!?
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_0600_00_sys,The hell <i>you</i> people doin' here?
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_0700_00_sys,Who're you?
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_0800_00_sys,What're <i>you</i> doing here?
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_0900_00_sys,What did you find?
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_1000_00_sys,Hand it over. Now.
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_1100_00_beg,"Oh, hell no! Don't you dare act like you've forgotten Beck's Badasses."
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_1200_00_bad,"Yeah, you barged into our home and beat us to a pulp! We hadn't even done anything!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_1300_00_buc,"Yeah, what he said!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_1400_00_beg,"Thanks to you, our wholesome thieves' guild is ruined!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_1500_00_art,"Oh, is that so?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_1600_00_cld,I have no idea what you're talking about.
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_1700_00_beg,Heh heh heh... The slums are too small for us. We're expanding worldwide!
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_1800_00_bad,We're going straight─we're a company now!
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_1900_00_blt,What are these guys babbling about?
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_2000_00_beg,"We're gonna strike it rich with our own treasure, just like Shinra did with mako!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_2100_00_buc,"Hee hee... Imagine the value, it's our ticket to the top!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_2200_00_beg,"Haha! It's an incredible find, worth a fortune!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_2210_00_beg,"Sure, it looks like junk, and we don't know what it is, but..."
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_2300_00_beg,I can feel the massive energy radiating from it!
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_2400_00_bad,"Once we sell this, we'll be rolling in gil!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_2500_00_art,"Hey, Cloud. Could that be...?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_2600_00_beg,You guys after our treasure too?
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_2700_00_bad,Tough luck! We found it first!
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_2800_00_buc,"Yeah, it's ours to appreciate!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_2900_00_bon,Mhm! Mhm!
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_3000_00_cld,Hand it over. Now.
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_3100_00_beg,Hah! You really think that's enough to intimidate us...
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_3200_00_bad,"No, please! It's all yours! Just don't hurt us again!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_3300_00_buc,Play dead! Play dead!!! I'm so dead...
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_3500_00_beg,Would you all quit freakin' out!?
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_3510_00_beg,"Now listen here, numb nuts. I've got a foolproof plan."
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_3600_00_beg,I call it...use a decoy!
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_3700_00_buc,Oh! A decoy!
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_3710_00_buc,So...what’s a decoy?
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_3800_00_beg,"All of you, that's who!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_3900_00_bad,"Oh, okay, we're the decoys... huh?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_4000_00_beg,"Very well, leave the rest to us!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_4050_00_beg,"If you make it out alive, meet back at the hideout!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0300_4100_00_bad,Damn it! Let's do this!
$CHADL_QST_01_0400_0100_01_bad,Ugh...
$CHADL_QST_01_0400_0100_02_bad,Blegh...
$CHADL_QST_01_0400_0100_00_bad,I'm so dead...
$CHADL_QST_01_0400_0200_00_buc,Ugh... I’m... so... dead...
$CHADL_QST_01_0400_0200_01_buc,Oof...
$CHADL_QST_01_0400_0300_00_bon,Mmph... Snore... Snore...
$CHADL_QST_01_0500_0100_00_bad,Let's regroup with Beck now!
$CHADL_QST_01_0500_0200_00_buc,W-Wait for me!
$CHADL_QST_01_0500_0400_00_chd,Mr. Cloud.
$CHADL_QST_01_0500_0500_00_chd,I've detected movement of the Ancient Materia. Could you update me on the situation?
$CHADL_QST_01_0500_0600_00_cld,Thieves stole it.
$CHADL_QST_01_0500_0700_00_chd,"I see, understood."
$CHADL_QST_01_0500_0800_00_chd,I've already pinpointed the Ancient Materia's new location. Please continue the investigation.
$CHADL_QST_01_0600_0100_00_chd,"Cloud, I've detected the Ancient materia."
$CHADL_QST_01_0600_0200_00_chd,"The bandits should be nearby, but it looks like they're busy cooking."
$CHADL_QST_01_0600_0300_00_chd,"If we approach from the front, they might escape again. Let's sneak up using the containers."
$CHADL_QST_01_0610_0100_00_bad,"How could you leave us behind like that, Boss!?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0610_0200_00_beg,Idiot! I had to do it for the treasure!
$CHADL_QST_01_0610_0210_00_beg,"I didn't want to either, I promise."
$CHADL_QST_01_0610_0300_00_buc,Promise? What's that?
$CHADL_QST_01_0610_0400_00_beg,Uh? Well... it's like being serious about something.
$CHADL_QST_01_0610_0500_00_buc,"Oh, I get it!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0610_0600_00_bad,Ugh... Do you think the mercenary will come after us?
$CHADL_QST_01_0610_0700_00_beg,We'll wait here until the merc gives up.
$CHADL_QST_01_0610_0800_00_buc,"I'm hungry... Can we eat already, Boss?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0610_0900_00_beg,Hold on a bit longer!
$CHADL_QST_01_0610_0910_00_beg,We call it 'well-done' because it's gotta be done right─not half-assed!
$CHADL_QST_01_0610_1000_00_bad,"Yeah, but don't you think it's a bit too burnt?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0610_1100_00_beg,"Shut up! Just watch and learn, amateur!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0610_1200_00_bon,Grr...
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_0100_00_mma,"God, I'm hungry..."
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_0200_00_mma,We want meat! We want meat!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_0300_00_mma,"Aw, smells like heaven..."
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_0400_00_mma,Hope there's plenty to go around.

$CHADL_QST_01_0615_0600_00_mma,I'm starvin' over here!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_0700_00_mma,Gimme meat! Gimme meat!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_0800_00_mma,"...Damn, that smells good."
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_0900_00_mma,Better be enough for us too.
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_1000_00_mma,My cut better be real bloody!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_1100_00_mma,I'm starving...
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_1200_00_mma,Meat! I need meat!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_1300_00_mma,...Smells great.
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_1400_00_mma,I wonder if there's enough for us?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_1500_00_mma,I prefer mine rare.
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_1600_00_mma,I'm starving...
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_1700_00_mma,Meat! I need meat!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_1800_00_mma,...Smells amazing.
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_1900_00_mma,Do you think they'll share with us?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_2000_00_mma,I like mine rare.
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_2100_00_mma,Huh? What's that?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_2200_00_mma,Uh... Did something move?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_2300_00_mma,Hahaha!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_2400_00_mma,"Whoa, is someone here?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_2500_00_mma,Stop sneakin' around!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_2600_00_mma,Huh? What was that?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_2700_00_mma,Did something just move?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_2800_00_mma,Hahaha!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_2900_00_mma,"Oh crap, is somebody there?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_3000_00_mma,No more hiding!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_3100_00_mma,"Hey, what was that?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_3200_00_mma,Did something move?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_3300_00_mma,"Haha, hahaha!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_3400_00_mma,"Shit, is someone there?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_3500_00_mma,I know you're there!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_3600_00_mma,Huh? What was that?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_3700_00_mma,I swear I saw something move.
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_3800_00_mma,"Haaa, hahaha!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_3900_00_mma,Crap... Is there someone out there?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_4000_00_mma,Stop hiding already!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_4100_00_mma,Phew... Just my imagination.
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_4200_00_mma,"Whoa, my bad."
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_4300_00_mma,Hm? Did they get away?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_4400_00_mma,"Whew, don't scare me like that!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_4500_00_mma,"Hmm, was it a rat?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_4600_00_mma,Phew... just my imagination after all.
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_4700_00_mma,"Oops, my mistake."
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_4800_00_mma,Hm? Did they escape?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_4900_00_mma,"Ugh, stop making me jump!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_5000_00_mma,"Hmm, maybe it was just a rat?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_5100_00_mma,Phew... Just my imagination.
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_5200_00_mma,Oops... My mistake.
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_5300_00_mma,Huh? Did they get away?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_5400_00_mma,Sigh... Don't scare me like that.
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_5500_00_mma,Hmm... Just a rat?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_5600_00_mma,Phew... Just my imagination.
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_5700_00_mma,Oops... My mistake.
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_5800_00_mma,Huh? Did they get away?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_5900_00_mma,Sigh... Don't scare me like that.
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_6000_00_mma,Hmm... Just a rat?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_6100_00_mma,Hey! What do you think you're doing?!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_6200_00_mma,I-It's an attack!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_6300_00_mma,It's the mercenary!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_6400_00_mma,Enemies incoming!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_6500_00_mma,Spotted a suspicious figure!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_6600_00_mma,What do you think you're doing here?!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_6700_00_mma,I-It's an attack!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_6800_00_mma,It's the mercenary!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_6900_00_mma,Enemies incoming!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_7000_00_mma,Spotted a suspicious figure!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_7100_00_mma,Hey! What do you think you’re doing?
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_7200_00_mma,W-we’re under attack!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_7300_00_mma,I-it’s the mercenary!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_7400_00_mma,Enemies are here!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_7500_00_mma,Suspicious person spotted!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_7600_00_mma,"Hey, stop! What are you up to?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_7700_00_mma,W-we’re being attacked!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_7800_00_mma,I-it’s the mercenary!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_7900_00_mma,Enemies have arrived!
$CHADL_QST_01_0615_8000_00_mma,Suspicious person sighted!
$CHADL_QST_01_0620_0100_00_beg,"Oh no, it's them!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0620_0200_00_bad,Run away!
$CHADL_QST_01_0620_0300_00_buc,W-What about the meat?
$CHADL_QST_01_0620_0400_00_bad,They're coming again!
$CHADL_QST_01_0620_0500_00_beg,Let's scram!
$CHADL_QST_01_0620_0600_00_beg,"We've been spotted, run for it!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0620_0700_00_bon,Gah...!
$CHADL_QST_01_0630_0100_00_chd,"Looks like they got away, huh?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0630_0110_00_chd,They might come back because of the food.
$CHADL_QST_01_0630_0200_00_chd,We can either hide and wait or leave for now to see how things go.
$CHADL_QST_01_0630_0300_00_chd,"These thieves are pretty sharp, aren't they?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0630_0310_00_chd,They should be back eventually.
$CHADL_QST_01_0630_0400_00_chd,You can either lie in wait for their return or temporarily vacate the area.
$CHADL_QST_01_0640_0100_00_chd,It appears the bandits have returned.
$CHADL_QST_01_0640_0200_00_chd,"This time, let's be careful to not get spotted."
$CHADL_QST_01_0650_0100_00_beg,Phew. Looks like the coast is clear.
$CHADL_QST_01_0650_0200_00_bad,Heh heh heh... And they didn't steal our meat!
$CHADL_QST_01_0650_0300_00_buc,"Huh, that's kinda weird! D'you think they weren't hungry?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0650_0400_00_beg,"They're just birdbrains, that's all."
$CHADL_QST_01_0650_0410_00_beg,"Anyway, gotta leave this baby on the fire a little longer to get it nice 'n' crispy."
$CHADL_QST_01_0650_0500_00_bon,Hamnah hamnah!
$CHADL_QST_01_0650_0600_00_buc,When can we eat?
$CHADL_QST_01_0650_0700_00_beg,Not yet!
$CHADL_QST_01_0650_0800_00_buc,How 'bout now?
$CHADL_QST_01_0650_0900_00_beg,It's gotta be crispier!
$CHADL_QST_01_0650_1000_00_buc,Can we eat yet?
$CHADL_QST_01_0650_1100_00_beg,I said it's not ready yet!
$CHADL_QST_01_0660_0100_00_beg,Alright! It's cooked to perfection!
$CHADL_QST_01_0660_0110_00_beg,"Presenting my specialty: roasted whole bird! Looks tasty, doesn't it?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0660_0500_00_beg,"Slurp... Hehehe, if I do say so myself, this turned out great!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0660_0600_05_beg,"Yeah, yeah, it's chow time... Come on, you guys, get in sync!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0660_0600_00_beg,"Alright, everyone, let's eat!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_0000_07_buc,Sniff...sniff...sniff...
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_0100_00_buc,"Oh, it smells amazing!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_0200_00_beg,That's 'cause I used my special blend of spices. Only the best for us!
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_0210_00_beg,"First, you gotta appreciate the aroma. Take it in!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_0300_03_beg,"How about that, huh?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_0300_00_bad,"Oh yeah, breathe it in! Inhale...exhale..."
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_0500_00_beg,"Alright, enough talking. Let's eat!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_0510_00_beg,"I'll take a thigh, since I'm the chef...ah, hot!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_0600_00_buc,"Boss, you okay?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_0700_00_beg,"We need to cool this down. Alright boys, blow on it!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_0800_00_bad,"Alright, let's do this! Ready... And... go, go!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_0900_00_bad,Fwoo...fwoo...fwoo...
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_1000_00_buc,Fwoo...fwoo...fwoo...
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_1100_00_bon,Pffft...pffft...pffft...
$CHADL_QST_01_0680_1100_05_beg,"Alright, blow harder! Even harder!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_0100_00_bad,Ah! We've been spotted! This is the end...
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_0300_00_beg,Get a hold of yourself!
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_0400_00_beg,"You really want this treasure, huh?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_0500_00_sys,You want the treasure that badly?
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_0600_00_sys,Yes.
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_0700_00_sys,Not really.
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_0800_00_sys,Just give it to me without a fuss.
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_0900_00_beg,"Oh, so you want it that much, huh? I knew this thing had to be valuable."
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_1000_00_beg,"Like we'd just hand it over, idiot!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_1100_00_beg,Then why are you chasing us?!
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_1200_00_cld,Work.
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_1300_00_beg,Really? Then tell us who hired ya. We'll take it off your hands ourselves.
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_1400_00_beg,"Not gonna talk, huh? Well, no way we're just handing it over!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_1500_00_cld,I don't have time to mess around.
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_1600_00_bad,"Uh, w-what do we do now?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_1700_00_beg,Relax. I've got a secret plan.
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_1710_00_beg,I call it the 'Sacrifice Plan'!
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_1800_00_buc,"Yeah! Sacrifice, sacrifice!"
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_1800_05_beg,Get over here.
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_1810_00_buc,Huh? What's a sacrifice?
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_1900_00_beg,You will be the sacrificial lamb!
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_2000_00_buc,Me!?
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_2100_00_beg,Here. Take this.
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_2200_00_buc,Wow! Can I eat it?
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_2300_00_beg,Throw it before they get ya!
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_2500_00_buc,I don't wanna be eaten!
$CHADL_QST_01_0700_2600_00_buc,Ugh!
$CHADL_QST_01_0800_0000_08_buc,Aaah!
$CHADL_QST_01_0800_0000_07_buc,"Ugh, I'm all roasted..."
$CHADL_QST_01_0800_0100_00_buc,That was delicious!
$CHADL_QST_01_0800_0200_00_chd,"Um, Cloud?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0800_0210_00_chd,It seems the Ancient materia has moved again.
$CHADL_QST_01_0800_0300_00_cld,"You can track its energy signature, right?"
$CHADL_QST_01_0800_0400_00_chd,"Yes, of course. I've also figured out where the thieves are headed."
$CHADL_QST_01_0800_0500_00_chd,"Well then, please continue with your investigation."
$CHADL_QST_01_0900_0100_00_chd,Cloud.
$CHADL_QST_01_0900_0200_00_chd,"Since you've been away from the grasslands for a while, let me update you on the situation."
$CHADL_QST_01_0900_0300_00_chd,A band of thieves is currently fleeing with an ancient materia.
$CHADL_QST_01_0900_0310_00_chd,It seems they've taken refuge in that building over there.
$CHADL_QST_01_0900_0400_00_chd,Please continue with the investigation and retrieve the materia.
$CHADL_QST_01_1000_0100_00_bad,"Uh, do you think Butch is gonna be okay?"
$CHADL_QST_01_1000_0200_00_beg,"If he's still alive, we'll meet him at the hideout."
$CHADL_QST_01_1000_0300_00_bad,"Uh, Boss, with this treasure, we'll finally be able to go straight, right? No more crimes?"
$CHADL_QST_01_1000_0400_00_beg,You bet! Thieving days are over. We're gonna be a company now.
$CHADL_QST_01_1000_0500_00_bon,"Yeah, yeah!"
$CHADL_QST_01_1000_0600_00_beg,We can't let anyone else get their hands on this treasure.
$CHADL_QST_01_1000_0700_00_bad,"Haha, we're gonna be a company. I'm excited!"
$CHADL_QST_01_1000_0800_00_bon,"Yeah, yeah!"
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_0100_00_beg,"Hey, where'd you stash the hideout key?"
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_0200_00_bad,Haha! I buried it somewhere around here so nobody'd find it!
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_0300_00_beg,You moron! Dig it up right now! What if thieves break in?
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_0410_00_beg,How did you guys get here...?
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_0500_00_blt,Why don't you just give up already?
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_0600_00_bad,"Oh no! Anything but that! Just listen to him, boss!"
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_0700_00_beg,"Don't worry, I've got a plan up my sleeve. I call it the 'Diversion Tactic'!"
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_0800_00_beg,"Heh, let's see you guess who's got it now!"
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_1000_00_sys,Bud
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_1100_00_sys,Bonzo
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_1200_00_sys,Beck
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_1300_00_bad,"Me? Uh, well... um... Ahhh!"
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_1400_00_bon,Bzzzt!
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_1500_00_beg,"Haha! Sorry, wrong answer!"
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_1600_00_beg,"Now, the correct answer is..."
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_1700_00_bon,Drum roll...!
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_1800_00_beg,Ta-da!
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_1900_00_bad,It's me!
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_2000_00_beg,"Look at them, they're totally flustered!"
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_2100_00_bad,"But, what do we do next, Boss?"
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_2200_00_beg,Isn't it obvious?
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_2300_00_beg,We run for it!
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_2400_00_bad,"Wait, Boss, what about the hideout key?"
$CHADL_QST_01_1100_2500_00_beg,It's buried over there. Forget about it!
$CHADL_QST_01_1210_0100_00_chd,"Cloud, could you try calling a chocobo?"
$CHADL_QST_01_1210_0200_00_chd,"First, try to find something that still has the bandits' scent on it."
$CHADL_QST_01_1210_0300_00_chd,It looks like they buried the key. Why not check out those shovels?
$CHADL_QST_01_1210_0400_00_chd,"Cloud, the bandits buried a key to their hideout somewhere around here."
$CHADL_QST_01_1210_0500_00_chd,Try searching for it with the chocobo.
$CHADL_QST_01_1220_0100_00_ch1,Kweh!
$CHADL_QST_01_1230_0100_00_chd,Looks like you found the spare key.
$CHADL_QST_01_1230_0110_00_chd,It seems the bandits have returned to their hideout.
$CHADL_QST_01_1230_0200_00_chd,"Please, try to retrieve the Ancient Materia this time!"
$CHADL_QST_01_1300_0100_00_chd,That's the building over there.
$CHADL_QST_01_1300_0110_00_chd,"Originally, it seems to have been a storage facility managed by Shinra."
$CHADL_QST_01_1300_0200_00_chd,We don't know what kind of traps they've set up. Please be very careful.
$CHADL_QST_01_1400_0100_00_chd,Cloud.
$CHADL_QST_01_1400_0200_00_chd,"It's been a while since you were last here, so let me update you on the situation."
$CHADL_QST_01_1400_0300_00_chd,"Currently, a band of thieves is on the run with an Ancient Materia."
$CHADL_QST_01_1400_0310_00_chd,It seems they're hiding out in that building over there.
$CHADL_QST_01_1400_0400_00_chd,"We don't know what traps they might have set up, so please be careful."
$CHADL_QST_01_1500_0100_00_bad,"Hey, Boss. Why are we pretending to be dead in our hideout again?"
$CHADL_QST_01_1500_0200_05_bad,Oh...
$CHADL_QST_01_1500_0200_00_beg,"Because we're tricking the mercenary, you idiot."
$CHADL_QST_01_1500_0300_00_buc,You think pretending to be dead will fool him?
$CHADL_QST_01_1500_0400_00_beg,Use your brain for once.
$CHADL_QST_01_1500_0500_00_beg,"You can't kill a dead man, right? So it’s pointless for him to attack us."
$CHADL_QST_01_1500_0600_00_buc,"Ah, I get it now!"
$CHADL_QST_01_1500_0600_09_beg,Heh heh heh...
$CHADL_QST_01_1500_0700_00_beg,This is our special trick—the 'Playing Dead Strategy.'
$CHADL_QST_01_1500_0800_00_buc,Ugh... How long do we have to keep pretending?
$CHADL_QST_01_1500_0900_00_beg,Hang in there. Just a little longer.
$CHADL_QST_01_1500_1000_00_bad,"We're not really gonna die like this, right?"
$CHADL_QST_01_1500_1000_03_beg,It'll be fine.
$CHADL_QST_01_1500_1000_05_buc,Maybe we will.

$CHADL_QST_01_1500_1100_01_bon,Zzz... Hngh... Zzz...
$CHADL_QST_01_1600_0100_00_beg,Ugh...
$CHADL_QST_01_1600_0100_01_beg,Gah!
$CHADL_QST_01_1600_0200_00_bad,Argh!

$CHADL_QST_01_1700_0500_00_beg,Hey! What do you think you're doing!?
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_0510_00_beg,Messing with the dead─have you no shame?
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_0600_00_blt,"Still alive, huh?"
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_0700_00_beg,"Look, we're on the same side here. We can resolve this by talking, alright?"
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_0800_00_sys,"""We can resolve this by talking""?"
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_0900_00_sys,I'm listening.
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_1000_00_sys,How much?
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_1100_00_sys,I've got nothing to say to you.
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_1200_00_beg,"Yeah, we're thieves, but..."
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_1210_00_beg,But this time we didn't steal anything! We just found it!
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_1300_00_beg,"And possession is nine-tenths of the law, ain't it?"
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_1400_00_art,"Hmm, that's a good point."
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_1500_00_beg,"How 'bout this? If you want it that badly, we'll sell it to ya. Whaddya say?"
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_1600_00_beg,Ten grand sounds fair to me.
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_1700_00_cld,You wish.
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_1800_00_beg,Okay...nine.
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_1900_00_cld,Keep dreaming.
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_2000_00_beg,"Fine, seven Gs!"
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_2100_00_cld,No.
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_2200_00_beg,This dispute's going to arbitration!
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_2300_00_beg,"I'm trying to be reasonable, and you take advantage of it!"
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_2310_00_beg,You're the real villains here!
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_2400_00_bad,Absolute scumbags!
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_2500_00_buc,Heartless fiends!
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_2500_02_bon,Hmph-hmph!
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_2600_00_beg,Don't say I didn't warn you!
$CHADL_QST_01_1700_2700_00_beg,This is the last resort of Beck's Company!
$CHADL_QST_01_1800_0100_00_beg,"C'mon, ya gotta let us off the hook!"
$CHADL_QST_01_1800_0200_00_buc,Off the hook! Off the hook!
$CHADL_QST_01_1800_0210_00_buc,Off the...off...hook...the...off?
$CHADL_QST_01_1800_0300_00_beg,All we wanted was to sell the treasure for some cash so we could stop stealin' and start fresh!
$CHADL_QST_01_1800_0400_00_bad,It's always been our dream to start a company and do honest work!
$CHADL_QST_01_1800_0500_00_art,"Hey, we could throw 'em a bone."
$CHADL_QST_01_1800_0600_00_cld,Two thousand gil.
$CHADL_QST_01_1800_0700_00_beg,Woo! Done! You guys got yourself a deal!
$CHADL_QST_01_1800_0800_00_sys,"Pay them 2,000 gil?"
$CHADL_QST_01_1800_0900_00_sys,Yes
$CHADL_QST_01_1800_1000_00_sys,No
$CHADL_QST_01_1800_1100_00_beg,"Huh? You're coming up a little short there, pal."
$CHADL_QST_01_1800_1200_00_beg,Hmph... And here I thought you wanted this thing!
$CHADL_QST_01_1900_0100_00_beg,"Hey, I've been waiting for you. So, you got that 2000 gil?"
$CHADL_QST_01_2000_0100_00_buc,Washin' our hands with 2000 gil? How's that supposed to work?
$CHADL_QST_01_2000_0200_00_bad,"Oh, that's simple. You just rub the cash all over."
$CHADL_QST_01_2000_0300_00_buc,"Oh, got it!"
$CHADL_QST_01_2000_0400_00_beg,"You think that's good? Some rich folks are so loaded, they bathe in money!"
$CHADL_QST_01_2000_0500_00_buc,"Wow, really? Would that even feel good though?"
$CHADL_QST_01_2000_0500_07_bad,Hmm...
$CHADL_QST_01_2000_0600_00_buc,Is the 2000 gil here yet?
$CHADL_QST_01_2000_0700_00_beg,Hold your horses. Waiting's a big part of business.
$CHADL_QST_01_2000_0800_00_bad,This is amazing. We're going to live straight from now on.
$CHADL_QST_01_2000_0900_00_bon,Mm-hmm!
$CHADL_QST_01_2000_0900_09_buc,Straightforward!
$CHADL_QST_01_2000_0900_07_bad,"Yeah, straightforward!"
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_0100_00_beg,"Haha, thanks for your business!"
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_0200_00_beg,"See, boys? That's how you make a deal!"
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_0600_00_art,"And no more stealing, right?"
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_0700_00_beg,You bet! No more thieving for us. We're 'Beck's Company' now!
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_0800_00_bad,"Company, company!"
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_1000_00_beg,"All right! From today, I'm the president and you guys are my employees!"
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_1100_00_buc,Employees? We're employees...
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_1110_00_buc,What's an employee anyway?
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_1200_00_sys,What's an employee anyway?
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_1300_00_sys,You're one of us.
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_1400_00_sys,We're family.
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_1500_00_sys,You're a servant.
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_1600_00_buc,"Oh, so we're buddies now! Let's make the company big together, yeah!"
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_1700_00_buc,"Family, huh? Hehe... It feels kinda warm and fuzzy."
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_1800_00_buc,Servants? Servants...
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_1900_00_beg,"No way, dumbass!"
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_1910_00_beg,"And you, stop messing with him!"
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_2000_00_beg,"Alright, you guys!"
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_2010_00_beg,"Time to work! Follow the boss, we're off to find some new treasures! Yeah!"
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_2100_00_bad,"Understood, boss!"
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_2200_00_buc,To the president!
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_2300_00_art,Do you think they've really changed?
$CHADL_QST_01_2100_2400_00_cld,Who can say?
$GRASA_NPC_10_0100_2800_00_mma,This isn't feed for the animals; it's their bedding.
$GRASA_NPC_10_0100_2900_00_mma,"If it doesn't dry properly, they get cranky and start pecking at my head."
$GRASA_NPC_10_0100_3300_00_mfa,"You need to always ensure there's enough feed. The fatter they are, the higher the price they fetch!"
$GRASA_NPC_10_0100_4300_00_mma,"I've been with my chocobo since it was born, and now it's gone."
$GRASA_NPC_10_0100_4400_00_mma,I know I need to move on.
$GRASA_NPC_10_0100_4410_00_mma,...But knowing and doing are two different things...
$GRASA_NPC_10_0200_0100_00_mma,"Well, look who we have here. Not often we get guests around this place."
$GRASA_NPC_10_0200_0200_00_mma,"Every now and then, some interesting junk washes up from Midgar or Junon."
$GRASA_NPC_10_0200_0300_00_mfa,"We used to catch fish here back in the day. Ah, the memories..."
$GRASA_NPC_10_0200_0400_00_mfa,They say this port was originally used by the Republic of Junon.
$GRASE_QST_01_0100_0100_00_grb,"Hey, sorry to keep you waiting! Piko's all set."
$GRASE_QST_01_0100_0200_00_grb,Here you go.
$GRASE_QST_01_0100_0300_00_grb,"Just blow this whistle, and your chocobo will come running."
$GRASE_QST_01_0100_0400_00_grb,Is there anyone who's never ridden a chocobo before?
$GRASE_QST_01_0100_0500_00_art,Me!
$GRASE_QST_01_0100_0600_00_grb,"Alright, you can use our practice area. I'll show you the way."
$GRASE_QST_01_0200_0100_00_grb,This way!
$GRASE_QST_01_0200_0200_00_grb,Where you goin'?
$GRASE_QST_01_0300_0100_00_grb,We get the chocobos ready for races here.
$GRASE_QST_01_0300_0200_00_art,Races?
$GRASE_QST_01_0300_0300_00_grb,"Yeah, the chocobo races at Gold Saucer. They're a huge deal around here."
$GRASE_QST_01_0300_0400_00_grb,Every chocobo farm around takes part.
$GRASE_QST_01_0300_0500_00_art,So you guys race too?
$GRASE_QST_01_0300_0600_00_grb,"Ever since Mom and Dad passed, we haven't raced..."
$GRASE_QST_01_0300_0700_00_grb,But we plan to get back in the game soon. Got one competitor we really want to beat.
$GRASE_QST_01_0300_0800_00_grb,"But enough about that. For now, just focus on not getting thrown off while riding."
$GRASE_QST_01_0300_0900_00_grb,"When you're ready, hop on a chocobo and let me know."
$GRASE_QST_01_0350_0100_00_grb,Chocobos will come running when you blow the whistle. Just call out when you're ready to ride.
$GRASE_QST_01_0350_0200_00_grb,"You can't practice without riding a chocobo, you know?"
$GRASE_QST_01_0350_0300_00_grb,"Looking good! Now, let's have a light run."
$GRASE_QST_01_0350_0400_00_sys,Do you want to try 'Hustle de Chocobo'?
$GRASE_QST_01_0350_0500_00_sys,Yes
$GRASE_QST_01_0350_0600_00_sys,No
$GRASE_QST_01_0350_0700_00_grb,Give me a shout when you're all set.
$GRASE_QST_01_0360_0100_00_grb,Y'all ready to run?
$GRASE_QST_01_0400_0100_00_grb,That was amazing! You and Piko seem to get along really well.
$GRASE_QST_01_0400_0200_00_grb,Maybe you and Piko might even be able to win a race!
$GRASE_QST_01_0400_0300_00_grb,"Well, that's how it is for everyone at first. You'll get better with practice."
$GRASE_QST_01_0400_0400_00_art,Thanks a lot for everything.
$GRASE_QST_01_0400_0500_00_grb,"Oh, by the way, you guys mentioned you're out of money, right?"
$GRASE_QST_01_0400_0510_00_grb,I think you might find some work in Kalm.
$GRASE_QST_01_0400_0600_00_grb,"Now that the Shinra troops are gone and things have calmed down, you should check it out."
$GRASE_QST_01_0400_0700_00_grb,"Oh, and while you're at it, could you take on a request from my sister?"
$GRASE_QST_01_0400_0800_00_grb,"She's been having some trouble, but she won't tell me what it is."
$GRASE_QST_01_0400_0900_00_grb,Krin hasn't been herself since mom left. They were really close.
$GRASE_QST_01_0400_1000_00_art,How about taking on a side job?
$GRASE_QST_01_0400_1100_00_cld,"No, we should keep moving."
$GRASE_QST_01_0400_1200_00_art,"Traveling isn’t cheap, you know."
$GRASE_QST_01_0400_1300_00_art,"Plus, helping out with odd jobs can be fun, right?"
$GRASE_QST_01_0410_0100_00_grb,Wanna practice with the chocobos?
$GRASE_QST_01_0410_0200_00_grb,The training track is open if you want.
$GRASE_QST_01_0410_0300_00_grb,Ready to go for a run?
$GRASE_QST_01_0420_0100_00_grb,"Keep riding like that, and you'll be a top contender in the races."
$GRASE_QST_01_0420_0200_00_grb,You're handling that chocobo like a pro!
$GRASE_QST_01_0420_0300_00_grb,I’ve got nothing more to teach you.
$GRASE_QST_01_0420_0400_00_grb,A few more laps wouldn't hurt.
$GRASE_QST_01_0420_0500_00_grb,You need to stay in tune with your chocobo while running.
$GRASE_QST_01_0420_0600_00_grb,"If this were a real race, you would've been laughed off the track."
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_0100_00_krn,"Oh, Cloud!"
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_0200_00_cld,I heard you might need some help.
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_0300_00_krn,"Huh? Oh, you heard from my brother?"
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_0400_00_krn,"I want to go pick flowers, but the monsters are making it too dangerous."
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_0500_00_art,I understand. It's hard for flower lovers to resist!
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_0600_00_krn,I want to gather flowers to make this.
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_0700_00_krn,My mom used to make these for us all the time.
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_0800_00_krn,"I want to make one too, but with all the monsters around, I can't get to the flowers."
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_0900_00_art,"Hey, how about we pick them for you?"
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_1000_00_krn,Of course!
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_1100_00_art,Cloud? What do you think?
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_1200_00_sys,Do you accept the request?
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_1300_00_sys,What happened to your parents?
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_1400_00_sys,How do you know Sam?
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_1500_00_sys,Ask Gringrin.
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_1600_00_sys,We'll take the job.
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_1700_00_krn,They died when I was really young.
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_1710_00_krn,It was a tragic incident.
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_1800_00_art,Oh...
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_1900_00_krn,We often went on family picnics.
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_2000_00_krn,"After we ate, Mom would make flower crowns for me and Billy."
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_2100_00_krn,I was so happy.
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_2200_00_krn,Billy says it's Sam's fault that Mom and Dad died.
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_2300_00_krn,But he won't tell me the details.
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_2400_00_krn,I want it to be a secret gift.
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_2500_00_krn,"For my brother, who's been working so hard since we lost Mom and Dad."
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_2600_00_art,"Of course, we won't tell him."
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_2700_00_krn,Really? You promise?
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_2710_00_krn,The flowers grow on a hill with a great view of Midgar.
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_2720_00_krn,"It's a bit far, but you can get there quickly on a chocobo!"
$GRASE_QST_01_0500_2800_00_krn,Thank you so much!
$GRASE_QST_01_0600_0100_00_art,"Wow, look at all these flowers! I've never seen so many different types before!"
$GRASE_QST_01_0600_0200_00_art,"Guess we have to pick some, huh?"
$GRASE_QST_01_0600_0300_00_cld,Yeah… Leave it to me.
$GRASE_QST_01_0600_0400_00_art,You don't look too confident about that.
$GRASE_QST_01_0600_0600_00_art,"Don't worry, I'm here to help."
$GRASE_QST_01_0700_0100_00_art,This kinda takes me back to when we picked flowers for the Leaf House.
$GRASE_QST_01_0800_0100_00_art,"Wow, these smell amazing! Were you drawn in by their scent, Cloud?"
$GRASE_QST_01_0800_0200_40_sys,Pick foxtails?
$GRASE_QST_01_0800_0200_20_sys,Pick stalks of red gerberas?
$GRASE_QST_01_0800_0200_10_sys,Pick stalks of yellow calendulas?
$GRASE_QST_01_0800_0200_30_sys,Pick stalks of blue forget-me-nots?
$GRASE_QST_01_0800_0200_00_sys,Pick stalks of white daisies?
$GRASE_QST_01_0800_0300_00_sys,"Yes, I'll take this one."
$GRASE_QST_01_0800_0400_00_sys,I need more time to decide.
$GRASE_QST_01_0900_0100_00_art,So cute! And so soft too. Perfect for a flower crown.
$GRASE_QST_01_1000_0100_00_art,"Ooh, now these are vibrant. Do you like these passionately bold colors, Cloud?"
$GRASE_QST_01_1100_0100_00_art,You've got a good eye!
$GRASE_QST_01_1100_0200_00_art,The language of this flower is 'love for family.' It's perfect for a gift.
$GRASE_QST_01_1200_0100_00_art,You chose the foxtails! I knew you would.
$GRASE_QST_01_1300_0100_00_art,"It's a start, but we still need a lot more for the flower crown."
$GRASE_QST_01_1400_0100_00_art,How about we gather a few more?
$GRASE_QST_01_1500_0100_00_art,Alright! This should do the trick. Let's go deliver them to Chloe.
$GRASE_QST_01_1600_0100_00_krn,Wow! Look at all these! Thank you so much!
$GRASE_QST_01_1600_0200_00_art,You're welcome!
$GRASE_QST_01_1600_0300_00_krn,I wonder if I can make a flower crown as beautiful as Mom's.
$GRASE_QST_01_1600_0400_00_art,"Well, it just so happens I'm a florist. How about I help you make one?"
$GRASE_QST_01_1600_0500_00_krn,Really?
$GRASE_QST_01_1600_0600_00_art,"Let's make one together. Right, Cloud?"
$GRASE_QST_01_1600_0700_00_cld,Yeah.
$GRASE_QST_01_1700_0100_00_krn,Look!
$GRASE_QST_01_1700_0200_00_art,Hmm... The combination of flowers is pretty unique.
$GRASE_QST_01_1700_0300_00_krn,But isn't it fun and interesting? I really like it!
$GRASE_QST_01_1800_0100_00_krn,Look!
$GRASE_QST_01_1800_0200_00_art,How is it?
$GRASE_QST_01_1800_0300_00_krn,"It's not the same as Mom's, but it's cute!"
$GRASE_QST_01_1800_0400_00_krn,"Thank you so much, sis, and you too, Mr. Cloud."
$GRASE_QST_01_1900_0100_00_krn,Look what I did!
$GRASE_QST_01_1900_0200_00_krn,It looks just like Mom's.
$GRASE_QST_01_1900_0300_00_art,But this one is made by you.
$GRASE_QST_01_1900_0400_00_krn,"Wow, I can really make it too! Thanks for teaching me, you two!"
$GRASE_QST_01_1900_0500_00_cld,Just give it a try.
$GRASE_QST_01_1900_0600_00_krn,Got it!
$GRASE_QST_01_2000_0100_00_grb,Is there something wrong?
$GRASE_QST_01_2000_0200_00_krn,Big brother!
$GRASE_QST_01_2000_0300_00_krn,"Here, this is for you."
$GRASE_QST_01_2000_0400_00_grb,"Did you make this, Chloe?"
$GRASE_QST_01_2000_0500_00_krn,Uh-huh.
$GRASE_QST_01_2000_0600_00_grb,Thank you.
$GRASE_QST_01_2000_0700_00_grb,How is it?
$GRASE_QST_01_2000_0800_00_art,"It looks nice, don't you think?"
$GRASE_QST_01_2000_0900_00_cld,Yeah.
$GRASE_QST_01_2000_1000_00_cld,Matching.
$GRASE_QST_01_2100_0100_00_krn,Do you think Billy will be happy?
$GRASE_QST_01_2100_0200_00_art,Of course.
$GRASE_QST_01_2100_0300_00_art,"He'll be delighted, won't he?"
$GRASE_QST_01_2100_0400_00_cld,Yeah.
$GRASE_QST_01_2100_0500_00_cld,We match.
$GRASE_QST_01_2200_0100_00_grb,Thanks for helping my sister.
$GRASE_QST_01_2200_0200_00_grb,"Because of you, Cloud, Chloe has become more cheerful."
$GRASE_QST_01_2300_0100_00_krn,I'll treasure this flower crown forever.
$GRASE_QST_01_2300_0200_00_krn,"Next, I plan to make a flower crown for Grandpa."
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_0100_00_krn,"Oh, Cloud!"
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_0110_00_krn,"I heard from my brother that you raced with Piko, right?"
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_0200_00_krn,"My brother said he will be focusing on races for a while, so he won't be coming back to the ranch."
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_0300_00_krn,I wish I could have seen Piko race too.
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_0400_00_krn,I hope my brother isn't pushing himself too hard.
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_0500_00_krn,"Oh, everyone, I just got a message from my brother."
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_0510_00_krn,He said he's training with the legendary Chocobo Sage.
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_0600_00_krn,"I heard from my brother that you caught a sea Chocobo, right?"
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_0700_00_krn,My brother mentioned he's planning to compete in the Gold Cup next.
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_0720_00_krn,Do you think he'll be okay?
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_0800_00_krn,I'd love to soar over the ocean on a sea chocobo someday.
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_0900_00_krn,"Cloud, congratulations on winning the Gold Cup!"
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_1000_00_krn,I can't believe our small ranch won! It feels like a dream come true! Thank you!
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_1100_00_krn,My brother told me about what happened to our parents.
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_1200_00_krn,They gave their lives to protect the chocobos and the ranch.
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_1210_00_krn,"Now it's our turn to protect them, my brother and I."
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_1300_00_krn,My brother cried on the phone.
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_1310_00_krn,Hearing him cry made me so happy that I started crying too.
$GRASE_QST_01_2400_1400_00_krn,"Ever since we won the Gold Cup, our phone hasn't stopped ringing with inquiries."
$GRASE_QST_01_2500_0100_00_gro,I heard you helped Chloe with making her flower crown? That was very kind of you.
$GRASE_QST_01_2500_0110_00_gro,"Allow me to thank you on behalf of her parents, Will and Clara."
$GRASE_QST_01_2500_0200_00_gro,"Oh! Sorry, I'm Will's father."
$GRASE_QST_01_2500_0210_00_gro,Will and Clara's children are Billy and Chloe.
$GRASE_QST_01_2500_0300_00_gro,"Easy to remember names, right?"
$GRASE_QST_01_2500_0400_00_gro,Ever since Will and Clara left...
$GRASE_QST_01_2500_0500_00_gro,"I can't retire yet, I have to raise Chloe and Billy right."
$GRASE_QST_01_2600_0100_00_gro,Well hey there! How are the chocobos doing?
$GRASE_QST_01_2600_0200_00_gro,"Leave it to Green Ranch for all your chocobo needs. For more details, talk to Chloe inside."
$GRASE_QST_01_2600_0300_00_gro,"I heard you won the race with Piko, didn't you? Amazing!"
$GRASE_QST_01_2600_0400_00_gro,I knew it from the first glance that you were something special. Looks like my instincts were right all along.
$GRASE_QST_01_2600_0500_00_gro,Hope Green doesn't get too cocky and cause trouble for Sam.
$GRASE_QST_01_2600_0600_00_gro,"So you met the chocobo sage in Nibelheim, huh? How's the old man doing?"
$GRASE_QST_01_2600_0700_00_gro,"Never thought both of you would visit the sage together. Blood runs thicker than water, I suppose."
$GRASE_QST_01_2600_0800_00_gro,"Thanks to you winning the Gold Cup, we've got a rush of customers here."
$GRASE_QST_01_2600_0810_00_gro,"It's exhausting for this old body, though."
$GRASE_QST_01_2600_0900_00_gro,"Now we've got to make sure Green Ranch's name gets out there even more, thanks to this opportunity."
$GRASE_QST_01_2600_1000_00_gro,"I'm excited to see how their grandchildren, who've inherited their parents' determination and spirit, will grow up."
$GRASE_QST_01_2700_0100_00_mfa,Howdy! Looking to use a chocobo carriage today?
$GRASE_QST_01_2700_0200_00_mfa,"Normally, I work on a nearby farm, but I sometimes help out here at Gullin Ranch."
$GRASE_QST_01_2700_0300_00_mfa,Heading out with a chocobo carriage today?
$GRASE_QST_01_2700_0400_00_mfa,Where are you headed?
$GRASE_QST_01_2700_0500_00_mfa,"Ahh, I love the smell of fresh grass..."
$GRASE_QST_01_2700_0600_00_mfa,Feel free to come back anytime!
$GRASE_QST_01_2700_0700_00_mfa,Please come visit us again.
$GRASE_QST_01_2700_0800_00_mfa,Isn't it wonderful to lie down on the plains?
$GRASE_QST_02_0090_0100_00_val,Welcome!
$GRASE_QST_02_0090_0200_00_val,"New face around here, huh?"
$GRASE_QST_02_0090_0300_00_val,"We're having a special today. How about a drink? A bit early, but we've got our reasons..."
$GRASE_QST_02_0090_0400_00_val,Business has been booming thanks to the chaos in Midgar.
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_0300_00_val,Welcome...
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_0400_00_cld,What's up?
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_0500_00_val,"You seem capable, huh?"
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_0600_00_cld,Most of the time.
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_0700_00_val,"Oh, that's fantastic!"
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_0710_00_val,I'm Vash. I could really use your help.
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_0800_00_val,"You've heard of Queen's Blood, right?"
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_0900_00_val,"Actually, I lost an important card in a card bout."
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_0910_00_val,Could you help me get it back somehow?
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_1000_00_sys,Will you accept the request?
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_1100_00_sys,What kind of card is it?
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_1200_00_sys,Get it back by yourself.
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_1300_00_sys,We'll take on the job.
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_1400_00_val,The Chocobo & Moogle one. It was the only rare card I had.
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_1500_00_val,"Even when dealing with drunks and complaints about weak drinks, I could get through it because I had that rare card."
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_1600_00_val,And that guy...
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_1700_00_tif,I understand how you feel. I’m a bartender too.
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_1800_05_val,Val...
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_1800_00_val,"Oh, really? It sure is tough."
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_1900_00_val,"If I could, I would! Not to boast, but I'm not strong enough."
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_2000_00_cld,I see...
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_2100_00_val,Rare cards from 'Queen's Blood' fetch a high price.
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_2200_00_val,"Yeah, we need to get it back quickly before it gets sold."
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_2300_00_val,Really? That's great!
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_2310_00_val,"Oh, right. Before I hire you, can I test your skills just to be sure?"
$GRASE_QST_02_0100_2400_00_val,"When you're ready for a card battle, just let me know."
$GRASE_QST_02_0200_0100_00_val,Alright! Ready to show me your card skills and win back my Chocobo & Moogle card from that jerk?
$GRASE_QST_02_0200_0200_00_val,How about a card match?
$GRASE_QST_02_0200_0300_00_val,Up for a bout?
$GRASE_QST_02_0210_0100_00_val,Give me a shout when you're ready to take on the challenge.
$GRASE_QST_02_0300_0100_00_val,"Oh man, if you can't even beat me, there's no way I can trust you with this task. Go hone your skills a bit more."
$GRASE_QST_02_0400_0100_00_val,"Yeah, that's some fine skill. No doubt you'll handle Virgil easily."
$GRASE_QST_02_0400_0200_00_val,"The one who took the card is Virgo, the guy working at the tower."
$GRASE_QST_02_0400_0210_00_val,I'll count on you to get revenge for me.
$GRASE_QST_02_0400_0300_00_val,"And if you get the card back, I'll treat you to a special cocktail."
$GRASE_QST_02_0400_0400_00_val,I got hold of a great recipe not too long ago.
$GRASE_QST_02_0500_0100_00_val,"Holy crap, I actually won? Unbelievable!"
$GRASE_QST_02_0500_0200_00_val,I'm starting to feel a bit more confident now.
$GRASE_QST_02_0500_0300_00_val,"Heh, don't get cocky just because you beat me."
$GRASE_QST_02_0500_0400_00_val,How can I ever win?
$GRASE_QST_02_0590_0100_00_vrg,Why not take in the beautiful plains from the top of the tower?
$GRASE_QST_02_0590_0200_00_vrg,Enjoy the breathtaking view from above.
$GRASE_QST_02_0600_0200_00_cld,Give back the card you took from the bartender.
$GRASE_QST_02_0600_0300_00_vrg,"Ah, I see."
$GRASE_QST_02_0600_0310_00_vrg,"So, Vash couldn't win on his own, huh? He sent you to do his dirty work?"
$GRASE_QST_02_0600_0400_00_vrg,"Heh, alright. But if you want it back, you’ll have to beat me first."
$GRASE_QST_02_0610_0100_00_vrg,I'll take you on anytime!
$GRASE_QST_02_0700_0100_00_vrg,"You're here to fight on behalf of your master?<br>Alright, I'm game."
$GRASE_QST_02_0700_0200_00_vrg,Ready for a match?
$GRASE_QST_02_0700_0300_00_vrg,I'll take you on.
$GRASE_QST_02_0800_0100_00_vrg,Heh heh heh... Feel free to challenge me again any time.
$GRASE_QST_02_0900_0100_00_vrg,"Aw, damn... I really lost?"
$GRASE_QST_02_0900_0200_00_vrg,"It was one helluva match, though, am I right? You and I're definitely gonna have to play again sometime!"
$GRASE_QST_02_0900_0210_00_vrg,"But uh, not today. Gotta run!"
$GRASE_QST_02_0900_0300_00_tif,Hold it. Aren't we forgetting something?
$GRASE_QST_02_0900_0400_00_vrg,"Right, the card!"
$GRASE_QST_02_0900_0500_00_vrg,"The one I won off Vash, right? Uh, shoot... Which card was that again?"
$GRASE_QST_02_0900_0600_00_vrg,Ah crap. I remember. The chocobo and moogle one.
$GRASE_QST_02_0900_0610_00_vrg,"So, this is kinda awkward, but... I don't have it anymore."
$GRASE_QST_02_0900_0700_00_cld,Is that so?
$GRASE_QST_02_0900_0800_00_vrg,"No, seriously! I-I flipped it!"
$GRASE_QST_02_0900_0900_00_vrg,"I was completely broke, so I ended up selling it to a card collector."
$GRASE_QST_02_0900_1000_00_vrg,It was a guy named Thorin who runs a card shop outside of town.
$GRASE_QST_02_0900_1100_00_vrg,You should pay him a visit.
$GRASE_QST_02_0900_1200_00_tif,"Looks like our work's not done yet, huh?"
$GRASE_QST_02_1000_0100_00_vrg,Looking forward to our rematch.
$GRASE_QST_02_1000_0200_00_vrg,That was a great match.
$GRASE_QST_02_1000_0300_00_vrg,"Wow, I'm impressed. Well done."
$GRASE_QST_02_1000_0400_00_vrg,I might need to revise my tactics.
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_0100_00_trn,Hey there. You lookin' to trade cards?
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_0200_00_cld,We're here for the Chocobo & Moogle card.
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_0300_00_trn,"Oh, sorry. That card's not for sale."
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_0400_00_trn,I only want true card pros to have rare ones like that.
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_0410_00_trn,"So, how about this..."
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_0500_00_trn,"If you can beat me in a card bout, I'll give it to you for free."
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_0600_00_trn,"So, what do you say?"
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_0700_00_sys,What will you do?
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_0800_00_sys,Ask about Queen's Blood.
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_0890_00_sys,<button=quest> Challenge him to a game.
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_0900_00_sys,Challenge him to a game.
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_1000_00_sys,Purchase cards.
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_1010_00_sys,Leave.
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_1100_00_trn,It's the most popular card game around right now.
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_1200_00_trn,The name comes from the legend of a queen who ruled the world before being executed by her people.
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_1300_00_trn,They say monsters were born from the blood that the queen shed.
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_1400_00_trn,"Players are everywhere, and card games are happening all the time."
$GRASE_QST_02_1100_1500_00_trn,"Heh, that's the spirit."
$GRASE_QST_02_1110_0100_00_trn,I'm always ready for a bout.
$GRASE_QST_02_1110_0200_00_trn,Feel free to come back anytime.
$GRASE_QST_02_1110_0300_00_trn,May you find the perfect cards.
$GRASE_QST_02_1200_0100_00_trn,"If you want the 'Chocobo & Moogle' card, you'll have to win it fair and square in a card bout."
$GRASE_QST_02_1200_0200_00_trn,How’s the Queen’s Blood deck treating you?
$GRASE_QST_02_1200_0300_00_trn,What brings you here today?
$GRASE_QST_02_1300_0100_00_trn,"You've got potential. With some more training, you'll come back stronger, right?"
$GRASE_QST_02_1400_0100_00_trn,It looks like I underestimated your skills.
$GRASE_QST_02_1400_0110_00_trn,Here's the card as promised.
$GRASE_QST_02_1400_0200_00_trn,"Next time, I'll be giving it my all."
$GRASE_QST_02_1500_0100_00_trn,"The cards have a voice, and you should listen to what they say."
$GRASE_QST_02_1500_0200_00_trn,That was a stimulating challenge. Thanks.
$GRASE_QST_02_1500_0300_00_trn,You've got yourself a fine deck there.
$GRASE_QST_02_1500_0400_00_trn,"You focus on mastering the game, and I'll stick to collecting. How's that sound?"
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_0100_00_val,You did it! You got my baby back!
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_0200_00_val,"To be honest, this isn't the first card I've lost."
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_0210_00_val,"And considering just how many I've lost, one this rare is definitely wasted on me."
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_0300_00_val,Here... It's probably better off with you.
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_0400_00_cld,Really...?
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_0500_00_val,But only until I've gotten good enough to win it back!
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_0600_00_val,Whew... That's a weight off my mind.
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_0610_00_val,"Right, enough of that! How 'bout I fix you two your drinks?"
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_0700_00_val,So this guy moved here recently from Midgar after the Sector 7 tragedy─you know how it is.
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_0800_00_val,"Anyway, he couldn't stop talking about this incredible cocktail he had at a famous bar in the undercity."
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_0900_00_val,The place is called 'Seventh Heaven.' Have you heard of it?
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_1000_00_val,"It's called 'Cosmo Canyon.' Beautiful, isn't it?"
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_1100_00_val,Here you go.
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_1200_00_tif,Thanks.
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_1300_00_tif,That was delicious. Thank you!
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_1400_00_val,Right?
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_1500_00_val,"But apparently, the original Cosmo Canyon was even better."
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_1510_00_val,"Unfortunately, it seems you can't have it anymore."
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_1600_00_tif,Maybe adding a pinch of rock salt might help.
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_1700_00_val,"Oh, rock salt, huh? Interesting idea. I'll give it a try."
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_1800_00_val,"Wait, are you the one who came up with the idea? The bartender from Seventh Heaven in the Seventh Sector Slums?"
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_1900_00_tif,"Someday, we'll reopen it for sure."
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_2000_00_tif,"When that day comes, please drop by. I'll treat you to something special."
$GRASE_QST_02_1600_2100_00_val,"Oh, I can't wait. I'll definitely be there, so keep up the good work. I'm rooting for you!"
$GRASE_QST_02_1700_0100_00_val,"I'm entrusting you with my Chocobo & Moogle card. Make good use of it, alright?"
$GRASE_QST_02_1700_0200_00_val,I still can't believe it. Meeting the creator of the Cocktails!
$GRASE_QST_02_1700_0300_00_val,"It was a nerve-wracking experience, but now it's officially recognized by the original!"
$GRASE_QST_02_1800_0100_00_val,"Since Wutai's broadcast, there’s been a surge in customers. Guess everyone's pretty anxious."
$GRASE_QST_02_1800_0200_00_val,"And to take their minds off things, nothing beats a drink and some card games."
$GRASE_QST_02_1900_0100_00_vrg,"Did you know? In times of emergency, this tower is also used as a lookout post."
$GRASE_QST_02_1900_0200_00_vrg,"I've been so focused on revising the evacuation manual lately, I haven't had time to play with my card deck."
$GRASE_QST_02_2000_0100_00_trn,There's a theory that Queen's Blood's actual origins can be traced back to an ancient war.
$GRASE_QST_02_2000_0200_00_trn,Let's hope reality doesn't turn into the world of those cards.
$GRASE_QST_02_2000_0300_00_trn,"With war on the horizon, more and more people are parting with their cards."
$GRASE_QST_02_2000_0400_00_trn,"As a fellow enthusiast, it's a bit sad to see."
$GRASE_QST_03_0090_0100_00_flt,"Everyone, please calm down!"
$GRASE_QST_03_0090_0200_00_flt,"We're arranging for repairs, so please bear with us a little longer."
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_0100_00_flt,"Ah, you're the repair crew—"
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_0200_00_flt,—or not. My apologies.
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_0300_00_blt,"Oh, we're better at breaking things than fixing them."
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_0400_00_flt,Now's not the time for such jokes. It's in poor taste.
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_0500_00_blt,"So, what happened?"
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_0600_00_flt,It seems there's a leak in the mako pipeline.
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_0700_00_flt,"I had a handyman patch it up temporarily, but it's not very reassuring without a professional's touch."
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_0800_00_flt,That's why I've been waiting for your arrival.
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_0900_00_cld,A handyman?
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_1000_00_flt,"Yeah, supposedly they're well-known in the slums of Midgar."
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_1100_00_blt,Bet they'd be worth meeting.
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_1200_00_flt,"Shall I introduce you, then?"
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_1300_00_flt,"In return, could I ask you a favor? Could you deliver a message for me?"
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_1400_00_sys,Will you accept the request?
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_1500_00_sys,What's the pipeline?
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_1600_00_sys,What's the 'merc'?
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_1700_00_sys,Accept the job.
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_1800_00_flt,"In short, it's a mako pipeline."
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_1900_00_flt,"We have a pipeline running from Midgar, bringing us mako energy."
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_2000_00_flt,But the pipeline's malfunctioning and we're not getting any mako.
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_2010_00_flt,"Our tank has a bit left, but I'm not sure how long it'll last."
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_2100_00_flt,"Each day, we nervously watch our dwindling supply of Mako."
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_2200_00_blt,"That's tough, man."
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_2210_00_blt,"But hey, why don't you try living without Mako for a change?"
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_2300_00_flt,"Haha, you're joking, right?"
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_2400_00_flt,Our maintenance technician is currently hospitalized after being attacked by monsters.
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_2500_00_flt,"We requested help from Shinra, but with all the chaos in Midgar, we haven't heard back."
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_2600_00_flt,"Then the mercenary showed up, saving us big time. We couldn't be more grateful."
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_2700_00_flt,"Oh, thank you so much."
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_2701_00_flt,"Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Fritz Bellenger, the mayor of this town."
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_2710_00_flt,I believe the mercenary is busy working over at a workshop outside of town.
$GRASE_QST_03_0100_2800_00_flt,Could you ask them to report on the situation and progress? Even a simple 'it's coming along' will do.
$GRASE_QST_03_0200_0200_00_flt,"I know the Shinra engineers are probably focusing on Midgar right now, but when will they come here? I hope we haven't been forgotten."
$GRASE_QST_03_0200_0300_00_flt,I'm so worried about the mako tanks running low that I can't even sleep at night.
$GRASE_QST_03_0300_0100_00_blt,"Mercs ain't rare, but you're probably the only one famous in the slums."
$GRASE_QST_03_0300_0200_00_cld,You know the slums better than I do.
$GRASE_QST_03_0300_0300_00_blt,"A mercenary, huh..."
$GRASE_QST_03_0300_0400_00_blt,You're the only one I know.
$GRASE_QST_03_0300_0410_00_blt,Anyone else would put up more creative signs.
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_0100_00_blt,Is this the workshop?
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_0200_00_blt,Huh? There's no one here.
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_0300_00_kre,You need something from me?
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_0400_00_blt,You!
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_0410_00_blt,Aren't you the kid who was badmouthing Avalanche?
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_0500_00_kre,What?! Cloud? Is this your turf too?
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_0600_00_cld,Are you the jack-of-all-trades who took the pipe repair job?
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_0700_00_kre,"I'm Kyrie, the freelancer. My services aren't cheap."
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_0800_00_blt,"You guys have no business sense, do you?"
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_0900_00_blt,We've got a message from the mayor. He wants a progress report.
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_1000_00_kre,"Yes, that's right, isn't it?"
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_1010_00_kre,"I really want to report this, but..."
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_1100_00_kre,"I'm missing the parts I need for repairs, so I haven't made any progress."
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_1200_00_kre,Can you help me gather the parts?
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_1300_00_cld,No way.
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_1400_00_kre,Think of it as helping out a promising junior. I promise I'll do anything you say.
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_1500_00_cld,Anything?
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_1600_00_cld,I'll help... if you stop calling yourself a mercenary.
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_1700_00_kre,Deal! Here are the minimum parts I need.
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_1800_00_kre,"I'd really like more, but I won't be greedy."
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_1810_00_kre,Bring them here once you have them.
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_1900_00_sys,Will you take on the request?
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_2000_00_sys,Where are the parts located?
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_2100_00_sys,"Alright, let's take the job."
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_2200_00_kre,I think you can find them in the scrap heap further ahead.
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_2210_00_kre,I'm sure you'll find some!
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_2300_00_kre,"Alright then, good luck!"
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_2400_00_blt,Aren't you coming to help us look?
$GRASE_QST_03_0400_2500_00_kre,I need to stay here to find... little screws and bolts!
$GRASE_QST_03_0500_0100_00_kre,Good luck with the parts collection!
$GRASE_QST_03_0500_0200_00_kre,Being a merc is tougher than I thought.
$GRASE_QST_03_0500_0300_00_kre,We need to gather them quickly before it gets dark!
$GRASE_QST_03_0600_0100_00_kre,Did you get all the parts?
$GRASE_QST_03_0600_0200_00_sys,Will you give her the parts you gathered?
$GRASE_QST_03_0600_0300_00_sys,Give her everything you're carrying.
$GRASE_QST_03_0600_0400_00_sys,Ask about the parts.
$GRASE_QST_03_0600_0500_00_sys,Hold on to them for now.
$GRASE_QST_03_0600_0700_00_kre,This isn't enough.
$GRASE_QST_03_0600_0800_00_kre,"Uh, we're missing some parts here."
$GRASE_QST_03_0700_0100_00_kre,I mean... It just barely meets the minimum.
$GRASE_QST_03_0700_0200_00_kre,"I thought you'd put in a bit more effort, but I guess that's all my charm amounts to."
$GRASE_QST_03_0800_0100_00_kre,"Wow, look at all this! You guys went above and beyond! You're officially getting the Kyrie Gold Star!"
$GRASE_QST_03_0800_0200_00_kre,As expected of the famous jack-of-all-trades! I can see why you have such a good reputation!
$GRASE_QST_03_0900_0100_00_kre,"Wow, look at all this!"
$GRASE_QST_03_0900_0200_00_kre,"With all this, we might actually fix it like pros. Maybe we can even charge a premium?"
$GRASE_QST_03_1000_0100_00_kre,Alright then! Follow me!
$GRASE_QST_03_1000_0110_00_kre,Time to fix that Mako pipe—let's go!
$GRASE_QST_03_1100_0100_00_kre,"Actually, I'm running away from home. I had a fight with Grandma."
$GRASE_QST_03_1100_0200_00_kre,"She always treats me like a kid, never lets me take on any work."
$GRASE_QST_03_1100_0210_00_kre,"I got so mad, I stormed out."
$GRASE_QST_03_1100_0300_00_kre,That's why I'm out here. I'm gonna earn big outside Midgar and show her what I can do.
$GRASE_QST_03_1200_0100_00_kre,Where are you going?
$GRASE_QST_03_1200_0200_00_kre,This way!
$GRASE_QST_03_1210_0100_00_kre,"Mercenary, help me out!"
$GRASE_QST_03_1210_0200_00_kre,Let's clean this up!
$GRASE_QST_03_1210_0300_00_kre,"Come on, over here!"
$GRASE_QST_03_1210_0400_00_kre,Let's get moving!
$GRASE_QST_03_1300_0100_00_kre,We've arrived!
$GRASE_QST_03_1300_0200_00_blt,You sure you can repair this?
$GRASE_QST_03_1300_0300_00_kre,Don't underestimate a slum girl.<br>I'm a pro with junk parts!
$GRASE_QST_03_1300_0400_00_blt,Heads up!
$GRASE_QST_03_1300_0500_00_cld,Leave this to me.
$GRASE_QST_03_1300_0600_00_kre,So cool!
$GRASE_QST_03_1400_0100_00_blt,"Damn, what was that all about?"
$GRASE_QST_03_1400_0200_00_cld,Probably the effects of leaking Mako.
$GRASE_QST_03_1400_0300_00_kre,Mr. Know-It-All over here!
$GRASE_QST_03_1400_0400_00_kre,"Alright, all done! Mission accomplished, and cash in the bag!"
$GRASE_QST_03_1400_0500_00_kre,How about we celebrate the birth of our Mercenary Union with a toast?
$GRASE_QST_03_1400_0600_00_cld,Did you forget our deal?
$GRASE_QST_03_1400_0700_00_kre,"You mean the deal where we team up and work together, fellow merc?"
$GRASE_QST_03_1400_0800_00_cld,Stop calling yourself a mercenary.
$GRASE_QST_03_1400_0900_00_kre,"Oh come on, it's not like it hurts anybody. I'll make sure to advertise you as well."
$GRASE_QST_03_1400_1000_00_cld,Don't disrupt my business.
$GRASE_QST_03_1400_1100_00_kre,Ugh! ...Whoa!
$GRASE_QST_03_1400_1200_00_kre,"Alright then, merc! Clean-up duty's all yours!"
$GRASE_QST_03_1400_1300_00_blt,Hey! Get back here!
$GRASE_QST_03_1500_0100_00_blt,What're we gonna do about the kid?
$GRASE_QST_03_1500_0200_00_cld,Seems like the repairs are finished. Let's report to the mayor and wrap this up.
$GRASE_QST_03_1600_0100_00_flt,"Ah, there you are! I heard from the fixer herself."
$GRASE_QST_03_1600_0200_00_flt,"I was told you helped with the repairs. Thanks to you, the mako supply is back on."
$GRASE_QST_03_1600_0300_00_flt,Thank you very much.
$GRASE_QST_03_1600_0400_00_cld,Where is this fixer now?
$GRASE_QST_03_1600_0500_00_flt,She rushed off right after I paid her. Probably to another job.
$GRASE_QST_03_1600_0510_00_flt,"She's quite the professional, always busy as expected!"
$GRASE_QST_03_1600_0700_00_blt,"Looks like you've got some unexpected competition, merc."
$GRASE_QST_03_1600_0800_00_flt,"Oh, before I forget, she left this in your care, insisting her fellow mercs be compensated."
$GRASE_QST_03_1700_0100_00_flt,It's a relief to see the mako tank filled up.
$GRASE_QST_03_1700_0110_00_flt,Looks like I can finally get a good night's sleep.
$GRASE_QST_03_1700_0200_00_flt,Just imagining an empty mako tank makes my legs tremble.
$GRASE_QST_03_1700_0300_00_flt,"How do you like the unique sights here in Kalm? The mako tank, the observatory tower, our sturdy walls..."
$GRASE_QST_03_1700_0400_00_flt,"For those tired of the hustle and bustle of Midgar, the peaceful life in Kalm comes highly recommended."
$GRASE_QST_03_1700_0500_00_flt,How about considering relocating here?
$GRASE_QST_03_1700_0600_00_flt,Did you see that footage from Wutai? They seem ready to start a war over mako.
$GRASE_QST_03_1700_0700_00_flt,"Even if war breaks out with Wutai, our town is well protected by our sturdy walls, so there's no need to worry."
$GRASE_QST_03_1700_0800_00_flt,"We're planning disaster drills here in Kalm, just in case."
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_0100_00_flt,"Ah, I thought you were the repair crew."
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_0200_00_flt,...But I see you're not. Apologies.
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_0300_00_blt,"Yeah, we're better at breaking things than fixing them."
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_0400_00_flt,"Given the situation, such jokes are hardly appropriate."
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_0500_00_blt,"So, what's the problem?"
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_0600_00_flt,It seems there's a leak in the mako pipeline.
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_0700_00_flt,"I hired a handyman for a quick fix, but it looks like they took the payment and ran."
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_0800_00_cld,A handyman?
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_0900_00_flt,"Yes, a young lady with quite a reputation in Midgar, or so she claimed."
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_1000_00_flt,I completely fell for it...
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_1200_00_flt,"Are you perhaps acquainted with him? In that case, it's fate."
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_1300_00_flt,Would you be able to handle the repairs?
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_1400_00_sys,Are you accepting the request?
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_1500_00_sys,What about the pipeline?
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_1600_00_sys,Can't you hire a repairman?
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_1700_00_sys,"Alright, I'll take it."
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_1800_00_flt,Our maintenance guy was attacked by monsters and is currently hospitalized.
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_1900_00_flt,"We requested help from Shinra HQ, but Midgar's a mess right now."
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_2000_00_flt,"We're waiting, but who knows when they'll come."
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_2100_00_flt,"Oh, that would be a great help."
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_2110_00_flt,"Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet! I'm Fritz Bellenger, the mayor of Kalm."
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_2120_00_flt,Please head to the workshop outside town.
$GRASE_QST_03_1800_2200_00_flt,I'd like you to take over the job that mercenary abandoned.
$GRASE_QST_03_1900_0100_00_flt,"Ah, there you all are! Just in time."
$GRASE_QST_03_1900_0200_00_flt,"Actually, I had a merc handling the repairs for a leaky mako pipe, but he got caught up with another job."
$GRASE_QST_03_1900_0300_00_flt,"So, he left for somewhere else."
$GRASE_QST_03_1900_0400_00_flt,"The area around the pipe is crawling with monsters, so we can't deal with it ourselves."
$GRASE_QST_03_1900_0500_00_flt,If only there were someone who could at least check the situation for us...
$GRASE_QST_03_2000_0100_00_kre,"Hey there! I'm Kyrie, the jack-of-all-trades!"
$GRASE_QST_03_2000_0200_00_kre,"So, here's the deal: I was supposed to fix that mako pipeline..."
$GRASE_QST_03_2000_0210_00_kre,but then I got another job and had to leave.
$GRASE_QST_03_2000_0300_00_kre,"Ah, the troubles of a busy girl."
$GRASE_QST_03_2000_0400_00_kre,"Anyway, I've written down the parts needed for the repair on a memo."
$GRASE_QST_03_2000_0500_00_kre,It's best to have plenty of parts for a thorough fix.
$GRASE_QST_03_2000_0510_00_kre,"I'll leave that up to you! Oh, right..."
$GRASE_QST_03_2000_0520_00_kre,You can find parts in the scrap heaps near the pipelines.
$GRASE_QST_03_2000_0600_00_kre,That's all from me. Bye!
$GRASE_QST_03_2100_0100_00_kre,"Hey there, mercenary! How's the part collecting going?"
$GRASE_QST_03_2100_0200_00_kre,"Sorry to spring this on you, but I've got another job to handle, so I need to step away."
$GRASE_QST_03_2100_0300_00_kre,"So, I'll leave the Mako pipe repairs to you!"
$GRASE_QST_03_2100_0310_00_kre,Catch you later!
$GRASE_QST_03_2200_0100_00_sys,Do you want to use the parts you've gathered to repair the pipe?
$GRASE_QST_03_2200_0200_00_sys,Fix it
$GRASE_QST_03_2200_0500_00_sys,Leave it
$GRASE_QST_03_2200_0600_00_blt,You sure you can fix this properly?
$GRASE_QST_03_2200_0700_00_blt,Heads up!
$GRASE_QST_03_2300_0100_00_blt,"Damn, that was one tough bastard."
$GRASE_QST_03_2300_0200_00_cld,It's probably because of the leaked mako.
$GRASE_QST_03_2300_0300_00_cld,Let's go back and report.
$GRASE_QST_03_2400_0100_00_flt,"Oh, everyone!"
$GRASE_QST_03_2400_0110_00_flt,"Thanks to you, the mako flow has started to trickle in."
$GRASE_QST_03_2400_0200_00_flt,"Even if it's just a temporary fix, it's helped a lot. Thank you."
$GRASE_QST_03_2400_0300_00_flt,Thank you all for repairing things so well.
$GRASE_QST_03_2400_0400_00_flt,"Thanks to you, the mako supply has resumed. That's a huge relief."
$GRASE_QST_03_2400_0500_00_flt,"Oh, everyone!"
$GRASE_QST_03_2400_0510_00_flt,It looks like you did some sturdy repairs. Thank you so much.
$GRASE_QST_03_2400_0600_00_flt,"Thanks to you, the mako is now flowing steadily into the tank."
$GRASE_QST_03_2400_0610_00_flt,It seems like the flow is even better than before.
$GRASE_QST_03_2400_0700_00_flt,And here's your reward. Please take it.
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_0100_00_olv,"Oh, y'all are with Avalanche, right? Broden mentioned y'all."
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_0200_00_olv,Looks like you're doing a good job dodging Shinra.
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_0300_00_olv,Hey. Glad to see Shinra hasn't caught you yet.
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_0400_00_olv,"Since you're here, could you help me with something?"
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_0401_00_olv,"I'm Oliver, the owner of this farm."
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_0410_00_olv,We're having trouble with a beast that's been attacking our livestock every night.
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_0500_00_olv,I think it's a monster. Could you find it and take care of it?
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_0600_00_sys,Will you accept the request?
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_0700_00_sys,Can you describe the monster?
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_0800_00_sys,What's your connection with Broden?
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_0900_00_sys,"Sure, we'll handle it."
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_1000_00_olv,That one's incredibly clever. Not a single trap has worked on it.
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_1100_00_olv,"I've even hired a hunter, but we've got nothing to show for it so far."
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_1200_00_olv,I love the natural beauty of the Grasslands and want to protect it—even if it means flying the anti-Shinra flag.
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_1300_00_olv,Someone decided to bring together people like us.
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_1310_00_olv,That's how I met Broden and Avalanche.
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_1400_00_olv,"Even though we have different goals, we always exchange information."
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_1500_00_olv,"Thanks, I appreciate it."
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_1600_00_olv,Is that your dog? Can I pet him?
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_1700_00_cld,I'd advise against calling him a dog.
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_1800_00_olv,Who's a good boy? It's you!
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_2000_00_olv,"Haha, what energy you've got! If your dog's sense of smell is sharp enough, he might be able to track the scent."
$GRASE_QST_04_0100_2100_00_olv,Could you check out the scene of the crime for me?
$GRASE_QST_04_0200_0100_00_olv,"If I lose one more animal, I might have to shut down for good. It's overwhelming..."
$GRASE_QST_04_0200_0200_00_olv,Not that Shinra would ever admit it...
$GRASE_QST_04_0200_0210_00_olv,But it's obvious their reactors are causing the increase in violent monsters.
$GRASE_QST_04_0300_0100_00_red,Here.
$GRASE_QST_04_0300_0200_00_red,This is it.
$GRASE_QST_04_0300_0300_00_cld,So?
$GRASE_QST_04_0300_0400_00_red,"It's been several days since the attack, and the scent isn't fresh. Other animals have mingled their smells with it."
$GRASE_QST_04_0300_0500_00_red,Tracking them will be difficult.
$GRASE_QST_04_0300_0600_00_red,The scent has faded quite a bit. It might be hard to follow.
$GRASE_QST_04_0300_0700_00_cld,Think a chocobo could track it?
$GRASE_QST_04_0300_0800_00_red,"Hmph. Even though chocobos have a keen sense of smell, I doubt they'd manage with this faint trail..."
$GRASE_QST_04_0300_0900_00_red,"Still, if you want to give it a shot, go ahead."
$GRASE_QST_04_0300_1000_00_red,"You could try it, but I'm not confident even a chocobo's nose could manage it..."
$GRASE_QST_04_0400_0200_00_cld,Looks like he's found something.
$GRASE_QST_04_0400_0300_00_red,Hmm?
$GRASE_QST_04_0400_0400_00_red,What? Really?
$GRASE_QST_04_0400_0600_00_red,Hmph... I have a guess too. Let's compare notes.
$GRASE_QST_04_0400_0700_00_red,"Wow... I couldn't detect anything at all, but chocobos have amazing senses, don't they?"
$GRASE_QST_04_0500_0100_00_red,Looks like there was a fresh attack here.
$GRASE_QST_04_0500_0200_00_red,It seems like there’s been another attack.
$GRASE_QST_04_0500_0300_00_cld,"Red, you want to take over from here?"
$GRASE_QST_04_0500_0400_00_cld,"Nanaki, you want to check this out?"
$GRASE_QST_04_0500_0500_00_red,"No, let's leave it to the chocobo for now."
$GRASE_QST_04_0500_0600_00_red,"No, I think the chocobo’s got this."
$GRASE_QST_04_0500_0700_00_ch1,Kweh!
$GRASE_QST_04_0500_0800_00_red,I'll help guide the chocobo to make sure it stays on track.
$GRASE_QST_04_0500_0900_00_red,I'll do my best to support it!
$GRASE_QST_04_0600_0100_00_ch1,Kweh!
$GRASE_QST_04_0600_0200_00_red,There!
$GRASE_QST_04_0600_0300_00_red,Found 'em!
$GRASE_QST_04_0700_0100_00_cld,What's wrong?
$GRASE_QST_04_0700_0200_00_red,"Since my time in the Shinra Building, my sense of smell has dulled."
$GRASE_QST_04_0700_0300_00_red,"There was a time when I could have tracked that easily, but now, thanks to the chocobo..."
$GRASE_QST_04_0700_0400_00_red,I've never felt so useless. I used to be confident in my nose.
$GRASE_QST_04_0700_0500_00_ch1,Kweh!
$GRASE_QST_04_0700_0600_00_red,Heh... maybe I should become this chocobo's apprentice.
$GRASE_QST_04_0700_0700_00_red,Heh heh... Thanks for the encouragement.
$GRASE_QST_04_0700_0710_00_red,"To become a true warrior, I've got to retrain my nose from scratch."
$GRASE_QST_04_0800_0100_00_olv,"You took him down, did you? That must've been tough."
$GRASE_QST_04_0800_0200_00_olv,"Were you the one who helped out, perhaps?"
$GRASE_QST_04_0800_0400_00_olv,"Haha, I've got a reward for a grumpy pup like you."
$GRASE_QST_04_0800_0500_00_olv,Here you go!
$GRASE_QST_04_0800_0700_00_olv,And here's your reward.
$GRASE_QST_04_0800_0800_00_olv,"By the way, I heard Broden's feeling under the weather."
$GRASE_QST_04_0800_0900_00_olv,"If you ever stop by Kalm, could you check on him for me?"
$GRASE_QST_04_0900_0100_00_olv,"I really want to visit Broden myself, but I'm too busy taking care of the livestock."
$GRASE_QST_04_0900_0200_00_olv,"I know it's a big favor to ask, but could you visit Broden for me?"
$GRASE_QST_04_1000_0100_00_olv,I want to protect the nature of the grasslands.
$GRASE_QST_04_1000_0200_00_olv,"If we want to protect the environment, we've got to stop Shinra."
$GRASE_QST_04_1000_0300_00_olv,"So, Broden is in Nibelheim?"
$GRASE_QST_04_1000_0400_00_olv,"I can't believe he was mako-poisoned... Damn it, it's all Shinra's fault."
$GRASE_QST_04_1000_0500_00_olv,Did you see that broadcast from Wutai? It’s finally time for Shinra to pay!
$GRASE_QST_04_1000_0600_00_olv,"Of course, you'll join us, right?"
$GRASE_QST_04_1000_0700_00_olv,Do you think someone in Avalanche could tell us how to join the anti-Shinra coalition?
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_0100_00_brd,"Oh, it's you. Looks like you managed to give Shinra the slip."
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_0200_00_brd,Back again? You look well.
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_0300_00_cld,We heard you haven't been feeling too well.
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_0400_00_brd,"Huh, word travels fast. Didn't think you'd worry about me."
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_0500_00_brd,"Since you're here, can I ask you a favor?"
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_0600_00_brd,"A friend needed some parts for a windmill, but in my condition, I can't help."
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_0700_00_brd,Could you take care of it instead?
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_0800_00_red,We should help him. He did look out for us.
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_0900_00_red,"Remember, he helped us escape this town. We owe him."
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_1000_00_sys,Will you accept the request?
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_1100_00_sys,You feeling alright?
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_1200_00_sys,What's your connection to Shinra?
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_1300_00_sys,Why are you against Shinra?
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_1400_00_sys,We'll handle it.
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_1500_00_brd,I've been having terrible headaches and dizziness.
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_1600_00_brd,Maybe it's because I pushed myself too hard when I was younger. My body's starting to give out.
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_1700_00_cld,Headaches and dizziness. Anything else?
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_1800_00_brd,Sometimes I hear...voices calling for me.
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_1900_00_brd,"Never mind, forget it."
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_2000_00_brd,I was in the military when I was younger.
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_2100_00_brd,"When my parents passed away, I left Shinra and took over the family business."
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_2200_00_brd,"To make a long story short, they took away my family and hometown."
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_2300_00_brd,Isn't that reason enough to hold a grudge?
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_2400_00_red,But wasn't this your hometown?
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_2500_00_red,Wait... wasn't this your hometown?
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_2600_00_brd,"This town was once destroyed by Shinra. Even after being rebuilt, it doesn't feel like home anymore."
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_2700_00_brd,I'm staying here to never forget the resentment and grudge I hold.
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_2800_00_red,Hmph. Living with such hate isn't healthy.
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_2900_00_red,"I can't imagine how hard it is for you. Hey, Cloud, let's help him out."
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_3000_00_brd,Thanks.
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_3010_00_brd,You can get more details from a woman named Mildred. She lives in the abandoned settlement by the sea.
$GRASE_QST_05_0100_3100_00_brd,The windmills are your landmark.
$GRASE_QST_05_0200_0100_00_brd,"Oh, it’s you. Looks like you gave Shinra the slip."
$GRASE_QST_05_0200_0200_00_brd,You never know where a Shinra informant might be. Be careful and don't draw attention.
$GRASE_QST_05_0200_0300_00_brd,"If you need a place to rest, you're welcome to stay here."
$GRASE_QST_05_0300_0100_00_brd,"Sorry to trouble you. The client's name is Mildred. She's a bit eccentric, but she means well."
$GRASE_QST_05_0300_0200_00_brd,I'll let Mildred know that we've got a top-notch helper on the way. Thanks for your help.
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_0100_00_mld,Did Broden send you?
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_0200_00_mld,I'm glad for the company.
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_0300_00_mld,Ain't she a sight to behold?
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_0310_00_mld,A relic from the Republic era. Shinra's designs are world's apart.
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_0400_00_mld,I'm itching to get this old girl up and running again.
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_0500_00_mld,But the pitch control gear is impossible to find.
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_0600_00_mld,Which is why I need you to find it for me.
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_0700_00_mld,Got any questions?
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_0800_00_sys,Got any questions?
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_0900_00_sys,How to find the gear.
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_1000_00_sys,The materials needed for crafting gears.
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_1100_00_sys,How do you know Broden?
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_1200_00_sys,What was Broden doing with Shinra?
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_1300_00_sys,Will Broden recover?
$GRASE_QST_05_0400_1400_00_sys,Nothing in particular.
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_0100_00_mld,"It's out of production now, so you'll need to craft it yourself."
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_0200_00_mld,"Oh, looks like you already have the crafting chip. No wonder Broden sent you—you're pretty capable."
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_0300_00_mld,"Next, you need to gather the materials as per the recipe."
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_0400_00_mld,"First, you need to get a Crafting Chip."
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_0500_00_mld,"Once you have the recipe, just gather the materials and start crafting. Simple, right?"
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_0800_00_chd,I've heard the details.
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_0900_00_chd,"For information from the Republic era, try analyzing the Lifesprings."
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_1000_00_chd,You should find the locations of Crafting Chips and more.
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_1100_00_chd,"So, please investigate the World Report!"
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_1200_00_cld,Let's analyze the Lifesprings.
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_1300_00_red,Fine by me. Only fitting that we learn the history of the planet as we seek to cross her.
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_1400_00_red,Oh boy! An adventure! C'mon!
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_1500_00_mld,"So, first things first...the transmuter chip."
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_1600_00_mld,"Once you got that squared away, it should be as easy as poppin' in the materials ya need. Piece of cake, right?"
$GRASE_QST_05_0410_1700_00_cld,Right. Let's check some lifesprings.
$GRASE_QST_05_0420_0100_00_mld,"You found the transmuter chip. Next up, item crafting."
$GRASE_QST_05_0420_0200_00_mld,"To get the ingredients you need, you'll have to hunt down a Quetzalcoatl from the Grasslands."
$GRASE_QST_05_0420_0300_00_mld,"What's this? You've already gathered the materials? Impressive. Now, all that's left is to craft the gear."
$GRASE_QST_05_0420_0400_00_mld,"Lately, I haven't seen any around, probably because of the mako reactor. Think you can track one down?"
$GRASE_QST_05_0420_0700_00_cld,Let's analyze the lifesprings.
$GRASE_QST_05_0420_0700_10_red,Yeah.
$GRASE_QST_05_0420_0700_00_red,Alright.
$GRASE_QST_05_0430_0100_00_mld,"We go way back... Like, way back."
$GRASE_QST_05_0430_0200_00_mld,"We both left town when we were young. Wanted to see the world, you know?"
$GRASE_QST_05_0430_0300_00_mld,"Eventually, he joined the Shinra military, and I became an engineer."
$GRASE_QST_05_0430_0400_00_mld,He turned out to be an outstanding soldier.
$GRASE_QST_05_0430_0500_00_mld,"After a while, he mentioned being part of some special experiment, and soon after, I lost contact with him."
$GRASE_QST_05_0430_0600_00_mld,"When we reconnected, he had already left Shinra."
$GRASE_QST_05_0430_0700_00_cld,What kind of experiment?
$GRASE_QST_05_0430_0800_00_mld,I’m not sure; he never shared the details.
$GRASE_QST_05_0430_0900_00_mld,I think his deteriorating health might be a side effect of that experiment.
$GRASE_QST_05_0430_1000_00_mld,"He saw several doctors, but none could identify the cause."
$GRASE_QST_05_0430_1100_00_mld,"I'm also searching through ancient, lost technologies, hoping to find a method of treatment that might have been overlooked."
$GRASE_QST_05_0430_1200_00_mld,"So far, I've come up empty-handed."
$GRASE_QST_05_0440_0100_00_mld,"I'm counting on you, friend."
$GRASE_QST_05_0500_0100_00_mld,"Magnificent, isn't it? This windmill is a mark of the republic."
$GRASE_QST_05_0500_0200_00_mld,"Hmm, how can we get it working again?"
$GRASE_QST_05_0600_0100_00_mld,"So, do you have any questions?"
$GRASE_QST_05_0650_0100_00_chd,"Cloud, it seems you've found the transmuter chip."
$GRASE_QST_05_0650_0110_00_chd,"With this, you can now craft the 'Windmill Gear' recipe that Mildred has been looking for."
$GRASE_QST_05_0650_0200_00_chd,All that's left is to gather the specified materials and create it.
$GRASE_QST_05_0650_0300_00_chd,"If you can't find the materials, try analyzing more lifesprings."
$GRASE_QST_05_0660_0100_00_chd,That's quite the rare transmuter chip you've discovered.
$GRASE_QST_05_0660_0110_00_chd,It appears to be a component once used in the construction of windmills back in the Republic era.
$GRASE_QST_05_0660_0200_00_chd,"Given its current rarity, someone may indeed be searching for this component."
$GRASE_QST_05_0670_0100_00_msg,Confirmed: Quetzalcoatl has been defeated.
$GRASE_QST_05_0670_0200_00_msg,"Congratulations, Cloud!"
$GRASE_QST_05_0670_0210_00_msg,I've burned the sight of your heroic deeds into my memory.
$GRASE_QST_05_0670_0300_00_chd,"Cloud, if MAI ever gets on your nerves, just let me know."
$GRASE_QST_05_0670_0600_00_msg,Huh? The volume is lowering... Wait!
$GRASE_QST_05_0670_0700_00_chd,"Once again, Cloud, congratulations on defeating the monster."
$GRASE_QST_05_0670_0800_00_chd,"Thanks to you, we have obtained valuable biological data."
$GRASE_QST_05_0670_0900_00_chd,"Additionally, the 'Quetzalcoatl's Talon' you acquired is a very rare material."
$GRASE_QST_05_0670_1000_00_chd,"It might come in handy for crafting, so be sure not to lose it."
$GRASE_QST_05_0670_1100_00_chd,"With it, you should be able to craft the 'Windmill Gear' now."
$GRASE_QST_05_0670_1200_00_chd,We should craft it right away and deliver it to Mildred.
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_0050_00_sys,Hand over the gear?
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_0060_00_sys,Yes
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_0070_00_sys,No
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_0100_00_mld,Now this is a quality design! No Shinra knockoffs can compare to republic ingenuity!
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_0200_00_mld,"Okay, time to see if she works!"
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_0300_00_mld,"Hahaha! Hot damn, look at that!"
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_0400_00_mld,It's amazing─incredible! Wow...
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_0410_00_mld,The blades are spinning─actually spinning! What a sight!
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_0500_00_mld,"Oh, I can't wait to find out how much power it can generate!"
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_0600_00_mld,I wish Broden was here for this. He'd've loved to see these windmills running again. Maybe one day.
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_0700_00_mld,"Well, anyway... thank you. You've helped me fulfill a dream."
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_0710_00_mld,Are you headed back to Kalm?
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_0800_00_cld,That's the plan.
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_0900_00_mld,"When you see Broden, please tell him..."
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_1000_00_mld,"""Get well soon. Let's go on another adventure sometime."""
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_1100_00_mld,"I wish I could've seen this with Broden, like old times. He would've loved to see these windmills running again. Maybe someday."
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_1200_00_mld,"When you see Broden, please tell him..."
$GRASE_QST_05_0700_1300_00_mld,"""Get well soon. Let's go on another adventure sometime."""
$GRASE_QST_05_0800_0100_00_mld,There's something fascinating about the technology of the Republic.
$GRASE_QST_05_0800_0200_00_mld,"But compared to mako, its energy conversion efficiency is lacking."
$GRASE_QST_05_0810_0100_00_mld,"Once I gather data on these windmills, I wonder what I should try to revive next."
$GRASE_QST_05_0810_0200_00_mld,Wouldn't it be amazing if we could combine the best of the Republic's and Shinra's technologies?
$GRASE_QST_05_0810_0300_00_mld,"I see, so Broden is getting treatment in Nibelheim, is he?"
$GRASE_QST_05_0810_0400_00_mld,Guess our travel plans will have to be put on hold for a while.
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_0100_00_brd,Is that so? Mildred was definitely excited.
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_0200_00_cld,"She said, 'Let's go on another journey.'"
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_0300_00_brd,I look forward to it. I've been working nonstop.
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_0400_00_brd,Maybe it's time I took a long break.
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_0500_00_red,That would be for the best.
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_0600_00_red,"Yes, I think you should."
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_0700_00_red,I smell something awful... It's just like Hojo's lab...
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_0800_00_red,"Ugh, that smell is terrible... Just like in Hojo's lab..."
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_1000_00_brd,"A journey... Yes, it's time for a new adventure."
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_1001_00_brd,"A journey... Yes, it's time for a new adventure."
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_1100_00_brd,Urng... Eh... Uh...
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_1101_00_brd,Aaah...hih... Aaah!
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_1300_00_cld,You okay?
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_1400_00_brd,It's just...the degradation. Every SOLDIER's gotta make their peace with it.
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_1500_00_brd,Now you know why I can't see any old doctor.
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_1600_00_brd,"You're a SOLDIER too, aren't you?"
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_1700_00_cld,"Ex-SOLDIER, actually."
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_1800_00_brd,Didn't mean to scare you. The symptoms aren't always the same. And who knows? You might be one of the lucky ones...
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_2000_00_cld,Right...
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_2100_00_brd,"Just...don't take your youth for granted, alright?"
$GRASE_QST_05_0900_2200_00_brd,"Do what you want to do. Don't let Shinra's shackles hold you back, understand?"
$GRASE_QST_05_1000_0100_00_brd,"I need to get better soon, so I can go see Mildred's windmills."
$GRASE_QST_05_1000_0200_00_brd,There are all kinds of rumors about SOLDIERs. Don't let them bother you.
$GRASE_QST_05_1100_0100_00_brd,"I'd heard the rumors about cellular degradation, but to be honest, I didn't really believe them until I was actually attacked."
$GRASE_QST_05_1100_0200_00_brd,I left the military to reopen this inn. I can't just shut it down because of some illness.
$GRASE_QST_05_1200_0100_00_mfa,"Oh, you're looking for Broden? I'm sorry, but he's not here at the moment."
$GRASE_QST_05_1200_0200_00_mfa,Sigh... I wonder where Broden might have wandered off to.
$GRASE_QST_05_1300_0100_00_mfa,Welcome! I've been expecting you. Broden mentioned you'd be stopping by.
$GRASE_QST_05_1300_0200_00_mfa,"You're with <i>Avalanche</i>, right?"
$GRASE_QST_05_1300_0300_00_mfa,It's great that you're here.
$GRASE_QST_05_1300_0310_00_mfa,Actually... Broden has suddenly disappeared.
$GRASE_QST_05_1300_0400_00_mfa,Could you handle some of his work in his absence?
$GRASE_QST_05_1300_0500_00_mfa,The client is a friend of the owner named Mildred.
$GRASE_QST_05_1300_0600_00_mfa,She'll be by the windmills near the seaside. Please ask her for the details.
$GRASE_QST_05_1400_0100_00_mfa,"For more details, please ask Mildred. You'll find her by the windmills along the coast."
$GRASE_QST_05_1400_0200_00_mfa,"The owner's been feeling unwell lately, and I'm a bit worried about him."
$GRASE_QST_05_1400_0300_00_mfa,Mildred and the owner have been friends since childhood. I hear they used to be quite the troublemakers back in the day.
$GRASE_QST_05_1500_0100_00_mfa,Hello there!
$GRASE_QST_05_1500_0200_00_mfa,"Since Broden is currently out of town, I'll be handling things in his stead."
$GRASE_QST_05_1500_0300_00_mfa,I've heard from Ms. Mildred.
$GRASE_QST_05_1500_0310_00_mfa,She mentioned that you took on some of the work in the owner's absence.
$GRASE_QST_05_1500_0400_00_mfa,We really appreciate your help. Thank you.
$GRASE_QST_05_1500_0500_00_mfa,"Here's your reward. Please, accept it."
$GRASE_QST_05_1600_0100_00_mfa,Welcome back! I just heard from Mildred; looks like the windmill is running smoothly again!
$GRASE_QST_05_1600_0200_00_mfa,You were a tremendous help. Thank you so much.
$GRASE_QST_05_1600_0210_00_mfa,"Here’s a small token of our appreciation. Please, take it."
$GRASE_QST_05_1600_0300_00_mfa,"I hope our owner, Broden, returns safely soon."
$GRASE_QST_05_1600_0400_00_mfa,"Until then, we, the staff, will do our best to keep the inn running smoothly."
$GRASE_QST_05_1700_0100_00_mfa,I'm sure Broden would have loved to see Mrs. Mild's windmills in action.
$GRASE_QST_05_1700_0200_00_mfa,"While Broden's away, I'll make sure to provide the best service to our guests."
$GRASE_QST_06_0200_0100_00_mma,"""Beck's Company""? Never heard of them."
$GRASE_QST_06_0200_0200_00_mma,Huh? Are they hiring?
$GRASE_QST_06_0200_0300_00_mma,Seems fishy. Who'd even apply?
$GRASE_QST_06_0200_0400_00_mfa,"Hey, what's all the commotion about?"
$GRASE_QST_06_0200_0500_00_mfa,Aren't those people troublemakers?
$GRASE_QST_06_0200_0600_00_mfa,"So, uh, can you really get a job in Midgar?"
$GRASE_QST_06_0300_0100_00_bad,"Step right up, folks! Beck's Company is hiring!"
$GRASE_QST_06_0300_0200_00_beg,Beck's Company offers great job security and generous salaries!
$GRASE_QST_06_0300_0300_00_buc,"Salaries, salaries!"
$GRASE_QST_06_0300_0310_00_buc,Uh? What's a salary?
$GRASE_QST_06_0300_0400_00_beg,You idiot. A salary is the money you get paid as an employee.
$GRASE_QST_06_0300_0500_00_buc,"Oh, so that's a salary? Nice, a salary!"
$GRASE_QST_06_0300_0510_00_buc,Huh? But I don't get a salary.
$GRASE_QST_06_0300_0600_00_beg,"Oh, that's because as the president, I’m holding onto it for you. Don't worry."
$GRASE_QST_06_0300_0700_00_bad,"Yes, Beck's Company is looking for employees!"
$GRASE_QST_06_0300_0800_00_buc,Why not work with us and our merry group?
$GRASE_QST_06_0300_0900_00_beg,Leave all your monster hunting to Beck's Company!
$GRASE_QST_06_0300_1000_00_bon,Woaaaahhh!
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_0100_00_beg,"Well, look who showed up!"
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_0200_00_blt,"""Beck's Company?"""
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_0300_00_beg,That's right!
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_0310_00_beg,"And guess what, we're hiring right now!"
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_0400_00_beg,"Oh, by the way, how about an interview while you're here? What do you say?"
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_0500_00_bad,"Oh, that sounds great!"
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_0600_00_buc,Interview! Interview!
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_0700_00_blt,Not a chance!
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_0800_00_beg,"Alright then, let's get started."
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_0810_00_beg,"First off, can I get your name?"
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_0900_00_sys,What’s your name?
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_1000_00_sys,Cloud Strife.
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_1100_00_sys,I’m not telling.
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_1190_00_cld,Cloud Strife.
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_1200_00_blt,You're actually answering?
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_1300_00_beg,"""Cloud Strife"" huh? That's a pretty cool name."
$GRASE_QST_06_0400_1400_00_beg,"Hmm... Noted, 'has a rebellious attitude'."
$GRASE_QST_06_0500_0100_00_beg,"Next up, I'm gonna need your work history."
$GRASE_QST_06_0500_0200_00_sys,Can you tell me about your work history?
$GRASE_QST_06_0500_0300_00_sys,I'm ex-SOLDIER.
$GRASE_QST_06_0500_0400_00_sys,I've done odd jobs.
$GRASE_QST_06_0500_0500_00_sys,I'm not saying.
$GRASE_QST_06_0500_0600_00_beg,"Wow, that's an impressive resume."
$GRASE_QST_06_0500_0610_00_beg,That definitely explains your strength.
$GRASE_QST_06_0500_0700_00_beg,"A mercenary, huh? Does that mean you'll take on any job if the price is right?"
$GRASE_QST_06_0500_0800_00_beg,We'll make good use of that.
$GRASE_QST_06_0500_0900_00_beg,"Let's see... 'Unemployed,' huh?"
$GRASE_QST_06_0600_0100_00_beg,"As you know, our company, Beck's Business, earns a living by slaying monsters and keeping people safe."
$GRASE_QST_06_0600_0200_00_beg,What kind of contribution can you make if you join us?
$GRASE_QST_06_0600_0300_00_sys,What kind of contribution can you make?
$GRASE_QST_06_0600_0400_00_sys,Monster hunting.
$GRASE_QST_06_0600_0500_00_sys,Advertising.
$GRASE_QST_06_0600_0600_00_sys,Lightening the mood.
$GRASE_QST_06_0600_0700_00_sys,Not answering.
$GRASE_QST_06_0600_0800_00_bad,"Boss, this guy's got the skills, no doubt. We should hire him as a fighting force."
$GRASE_QST_06_0600_0900_00_buc,"Yeah, he totally thrashed us."
$GRASE_QST_06_0600_1000_00_beg,"Oh ho, then maybe we should have you hold a sign and sing an advertising jingle for us!"
$GRASE_QST_06_0600_1100_00_beg,No need to grovel! Just call Beck from Beck's Company!
$GRASE_QST_06_0600_1200_00_beg,"Oh, that's surprising."
$GRASE_QST_06_0600_1300_00_blt,That's priceless!
$GRASE_QST_06_0600_1500_00_beg,Let's see... 'No intention of cooperating'.
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_0100_00_beg,"I see, I see."
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_0110_00_beg,Hey!
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_0200_00_beg,We were just struggling to take down a monster.
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_0300_00_beg,Let's leave everything to him.
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_0400_00_beg,"After a proper discussion, we've decided to appoint you. Congratulations!"
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_0500_00_bad,Congratulations!
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_0600_00_buc,Congrats!
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_0700_00_bon,Congraturations!
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_0800_00_beg,Your skills and track record are perfect. We've been waiting for someone like you.
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_0900_00_beg,Please set an example for the other employees and lead them.
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_0910_00_beg,Welcome to the BB family!
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_1000_00_beg,"Some might call you 'surly,' but I can tell you're just shy."
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_1100_00_beg,And I have full confidence your superiors will help get you outta that shell in no time.
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_1110_00_beg,Welcome to the family!
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_1200_00_blt,Hold up. He didn't say a damn thing and he still got the job?
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_1300_00_beg,"We're not lookin' for a yes-man, and a man's better than no man!"
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_1400_00_beg,"Besides, he's all-business, and so are we. It ain't called 'Beck's Business' for nothin'!"
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_1500_00_buc,"I'm your superior, and you're my you-perior!"
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_1600_00_bad,"We've got some big expectations for you, rookie!"
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_1700_00_beg,"Okay! Now that the formalities are outta the way, it's time for your first assignment."
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_1800_00_beg,There's an old highway on the outskirts of town.
$GRASE_QST_06_0700_1900_00_beg,"Hey rookie, go on ahead and get ready to fight some monsters."
0100_00_blt,You serious about this?
0200_00_cld,"Hard not to be, isn't it?"
0300_00_cld,Who knows... maybe it’s just what we need.
0400_00_blt,You better not be joking about this!
$GRASE_QST_06_0900_0100_00_beg,I need you to handle some monsters on the abandoned highway outside town.
$GRASE_QST_06_0900_0110_00_beg,"Remember, you're representing our company—do a good job."
$GRASE_QST_06_0900_0200_00_bad,"Honestly, ever since we became a company, we've only been failing."
$GRASE_QST_06_0900_0210_00_bad,We're really glad you showed up.
$GRASE_QST_06_0900_0300_00_beg,"Hey, don't spill the beans!"
$GRASE_QST_06_0900_0300_05_bad,Huh?
$GRASE_QST_06_0900_0400_00_buc,You can call me 'Butch the Great.'
$GRASE_QST_06_0900_0500_00_bon,"Me too, call me 'The Great Burt.'"
$GRASE_QST_06_1000_0100_00_blt,Time to handle Beck's company's business.
$GRASE_QST_06_1000_0200_00_bad,"Hey, rookies! How's it going over there?"
$GRASE_QST_06_1000_0300_00_buc,You already taken care of it?
$GRASE_QST_06_1000_0400_00_beg,"They're still here, aren't they!?"
$GRASE_QST_06_1000_0410_00_beg,"Damn it, we arrived too early."
$GRASE_QST_06_1000_0500_00_beg,"Rookie, finish them off!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1100_0100_00_beg,"Hey! Work harder, dammit!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1100_0200_00_beg,"You better pull your weight, rookie!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1100_0300_00_beg,Show those uglies how Beck's Business does it!
$GRASE_QST_06_1100_0400_00_bad,"Not half bad, rookie!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1100_0500_00_bad,Looks like you got things pretty well handled.
$GRASE_QST_06_1100_0600_00_bad,Mop the floor with 'em!
$GRASE_QST_06_1100_0700_00_buc,Fight! Fight! Fight!
$GRASE_QST_06_1100_0800_00_buc,We got your back!
$GRASE_QST_06_1100_0900_00_buc,Kill 'em!
$GRASE_QST_06_1100_1000_00_bon,Gar!
$GRASE_QST_06_1100_1100_00_bon,"Come on, you can do it!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1100_1200_00_bon,Keep pushing! Keep going!
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_0100_00_beg,You showed 'em who's boss!
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_0200_00_beg,"And as your boss, I'll keep that in mind during your performance evalua... Huh?"
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_0300_00_mma,Look who it is: Beck's Buttmunches!
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_0400_00_beg,What'd you say!?
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_0500_00_mma,You ran outta Midgar so fast we didn't get to say goodbye.
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_0510_00_mma,Heard you went straight and started a business.
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_0600_00_mma,So me and the boys thought we oughta pay you a visit─celebrate this exciting new venture of yours!
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_0610_00_mma,It'll be a party.
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_0700_00_buc,Aah!
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_0900_00_beg,"Well, ain't that thoughtful. Okay─let's do it!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_0910_00_beg,"Hey, rookies!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_1000_00_beg,Leave this to us!
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_1100_00_bad,You got it!
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_1200_00_buc,We're on it!
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_1300_00_bon,Grr arg!
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_1400_00_mma,You're gonna pay for what you've done!
$GRASE_QST_06_1200_1500_00_blt,We have nothing to do with this!
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_0100_00_beg,Hahaha! This is the might of the Beck Company!
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_0200_00_mma,"What's so great about your company, anyway?"
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_0300_00_beg,Huh? What'd you just say?
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_0400_00_mma,"We're supposed to be outlaws, remember?"
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_0410_00_mma,"We're shunned by the slums─laughed at, mocked."
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_0500_00_mma,"But we lived freely, didn't we?"
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_0600_00_mma,"And now, just 'cause you got beat by some strong guy, you're running away?"
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_0700_00_mma,"No matter how many times we lose, we pretend to be dead and stubbornly survive!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_0710_00_mma,Company? Don't be ridiculous! Being an outlaw means not being bound by anyone!
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_0800_00_mma,"Wake up, man!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_0900_00_buc,Boss...
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_1000_00_bad,I really don't wanna be in-laws!
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_1100_00_beg,Heh... Seems I almost got used to the quiet life.
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_1200_00_beg,"Alright, listen up!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_1210_00_beg,"As of today, Beck's Business is shutting down."
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_1300_00_beg,"And in its place, I proclaim the formation of Beck's Bikers—a gang of outlaws who'll ride across the world!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_1400_00_bad,Boss!
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_1500_00_buc,"Yeah, Boss!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_1600_00_bon,Meh Blar!
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_1700_00_beg,"Alright, boys! Follow me!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_1800_00_mma,"You got it, Boss!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_1801_00_mma,"You got it, Boss!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_1802_00_mma,"You got it, Boss!"
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_1900_00_beg,"Sorry, guys. You're fired."
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_2000_00_beg,"Next time we meet, better watch your backs."
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_2200_00_blt,They're living one wild life...
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_2300_00_cld,Gotta say─a bit envious.
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_2400_00_cld,...Just kidding.
$GRASE_QST_06_1300_2401_00_cld,...Just kidding.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_0100_00_mma,I hear Midgar's in trouble right now.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_0200_00_mma,"First the reactors get bombed, now there's talk of a massive hurricane?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_0300_00_mma,I heard Avalanche and Wutai are behind the sabotage.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_0500_00_mma,Who the heck do Avalanche think they are? I'd love to knock 'em out.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_0600_00_mfa,What's going to happen to Kalm's mako energy supply?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_0900_00_mfa,What'll happen to us if war breaks out with Wutai again?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_1000_00_mfa,Did the Sector 7 plate really fall?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_2100_00_mma,Don't expect a warm welcome here in Kalm.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_2110_00_mma,We're busy dealing with the aftermath of the Midgar incident!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_2200_00_mma,"Midgar's on lockdown, so don't even think about leaving town."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_2500_00_mma,The current monster alert level is at danger status!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_2510_00_mma,The mako spillover from Midgar is causing the monsters in the Grasslands to go wild.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_2600_00_mma,Leaving town is strictly prohibited!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_4000_00_mma,"Ahh... the air is so refreshing. Thanks to Avalanche, we get a brief holiday."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_4100_00_mma,Gotta enjoy it to the fullest.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_4200_00_mma,Those bumpy roads to Midgar are a real pain in the butt.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_4300_00_mma,This chair is amazing just because it doesn't shake.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_4800_00_mfa,"Hey, stop goofing off and get to work!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_5500_00_mmk,I want to go see the Windmill Village. I heard it's an old republic-era ruin.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_5600_00_mmk,"It'll be a great history lesson, too."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_5700_00_mma,"Hang in there, buddy."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_5800_00_mma,The ruins tour has been canceled.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_6600_00_mma,"Listen, bro! I just saw this super cute girl! Pink skirt and a ribbon in her hair!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_6800_00_mma,"Really, bro? I just spotted a new girl with abs of steel!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_7000_00_mma,Alright! Let's check out the new girl! For the Singles Club!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_7100_00_mma,"You do realize it's just the two of us in that club, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_7200_00_mma,But what are we supposed to do after we spot a cute girl?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_7300_00_mma,"Don't worry, brother!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_7400_00_mma,Just crash into her like an elphadunk!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_7600_00_mma,"Alright, I'll charge ahead like a Kalm Fang!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_7700_00_mma,"Alright, the days of the Lonely Hearts Club are numbered!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_7800_00_mma,Fleeing from Midgar was a real nightmare.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_7810_00_mma,"The roads were rough, and the monsters were even worse."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_7900_00_mfa,You're the one who suddenly decided we should flee to Kalm!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_8000_00_mfa,"So, what do we do now?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_8100_00_mma,"Well, take your time and make yourselves comfortable."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_8110_00_mma,"Compared to Midgar, there are neither jobs nor entertainment here."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_9100_00_mma,The foreman has been working us to the bone ever since he decided to create new products.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_9200_00_mma,Same here. We're supposed to revitalize the town with 'Kalm Kokeshi' dolls.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_9300_00_mma,"Meanwhile, we're on leave thanks to the lockdown in Midgar."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0100_9310_00_mma,We don't even get paid.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_0100_00_mma,The meter on the mako tank's clearly gone down.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_0300_00_mma,Avalanche's downright crazy. How the hell d'they expect us to live without mako!?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_0400_00_mma,"If a twister like that hit us, I could kiss my house goodbye."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_0500_00_mma,I heard those Avalanche guys left Midgar and are on the run now.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_0600_00_mfa,I can't get a hold of my friend! What should I do? What if they're...
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_0800_00_mfa,"My washing machine's given up the ghost. You don't think it's got something to do with the drop in mako, do you?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_0900_00_mfa,It's honestly frightening how many people have evacuated from Midgar.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_1000_00_mfa,"Oh, please. Does Avalanche really think we can get by without Shinra?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_2100_00_mfa,"You know why Rufus had to step up, don't you? Everyone's saying it's 'cause his dad caught something─the man's on his deathbed."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_2200_00_mfa,The Midgar news broadcasts back it up.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_2500_00_mfa,"So, where exactly do your sources get their information?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_2600_00_mfa,"It's probably something dubious like Wall Market Radio, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_3110_00_mfa,I hope that child wasn't caught up in the disaster.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_3200_00_mfa,"I've tried contacting them countless times, but it's always the same—no response. Are they really safe?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_3900_00_mma,Our inspection team used to conduct regular surveys of Midgar's reactors.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_4000_00_mma,"But this term, the surveys were canceled due to the reactor bombings. Sigh... I really wanted to go inspect them."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_6000_00_mfa,I totally get it. My dog is so cute that I can't stop taking pictures of him every day.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_6100_00_mfa,"Totally! Even when he's in the same pose, I just can't help snapping another picture."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_6110_00_mfa,"Want to see some? I'm telling you, she's adorable."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_6200_00_mma,"Seriously, where did you manage to find a cactuar? They aren't around here, are they?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_6300_00_mma,She's late. Too late... Or was I too early?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_6310_00_mma,Was getting here a day early too much?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_6400_00_mma,Did I go overboard with my preparation? But the weekly love horoscope said...
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_6500_00_mma,Be patient and wait for the right moment.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_6600_00_mmk,I wanna climb the observation tower next! You can see Midgar from up there.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_6610_00_mmk,I need to check if Plates 2 and 3 are safe.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_6700_00_mfa,"You really love Midgar, don't you?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_6710_00_mfa,"Someday, you'll join SOLDIER and protect the city, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_7900_00_mfa,Guess what!? I've been chosen to dance at the harvest festival!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_8000_00_mma,That's amazing! Have you received your costume yet?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_8010_00_mma,I'd love to see it.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_8100_00_mfk,That's so cool! I hope I get picked as a dancer soon.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_8200_00_mmk,"Hey, do you know about the card game Queen's Blood?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_8210_00_mmk,"Everyone's playing it, so I wanna try too. Can you buy it for me?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_8300_00_mma,"Alright, I'll get it for you. I've been wanting to play it too."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_8500_00_mma,"Hehehe, my darling little mako tank, you look adorable today too."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_8600_00_mma,"Oh, there's a stain here. I'll clean it up for you right now."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_9100_00_mma,"That senior is petting the tank again. No way, the pipes are way cuter."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_9200_00_mma,I love how polished and shiny they are.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_9400_00_mma,Land around reactors becomes barren.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_9500_00_mma,I'm just glad we get our mako from Midgar.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0200_9510_00_mma,It's best to just let them handle the energy supply and enjoy the advantages.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0300_0100_00_mfa,Hello! Welcome to the Inn at Kalm.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0300_0200_00_mfa,"Please, make yourself at home."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0300_0400_00_mfa,Safe travels!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0300_0500_00_mfa,We hope you found your stay with us refreshing.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0300_0700_00_mfa,I need to keep this place looking spick-and-span. Don't wanna let Broden down.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0300_0800_00_mfa,Especially after he insisted I focus exclusively on cleaning!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_0100_00_mma,"Currently, Midgar is facing an unprecedented crisis."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_0110_00_mma,"Starting with the reactor bombings and the collapse of the Sector 7 plate,"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_0200_00_mma,"a sudden tornado struck the Midgar Highway,"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_0300_00_mma,causing extensive damage from Sector 0 through Sector 2.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_0400_00_mma,"Mayor Domino and the city authorities, with advice from the Shinra Company,"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_0410_00_mma,announced that this tornado was an attack by the anti-Shinra group 'Avalanche'.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_0500_00_mma,They believe that it was caused by an unknown weapon.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_0600_00_mma,They are also investigating the possibility of Wutai's involvement during the current ceasefire.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_2700_00_mma,"With the reactor bombings and the plate collapse, what's going to happen to Midgar?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_2800_00_mma,"If a war with Wutai breaks out, Kalm will become a forward base."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_2810_00_mma,Could we get caught up in this?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_3200_00_mma,Kalm's wine is very delicate. Any minor issue can ruin the taste immediately.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_3300_00_mma,"In these times, it’s getting more and more bitter."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_3310_00_mma,"It might even become too harsh to drink. Honestly, I'm worried."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_4700_00_mfa,I finally got it—the rare card I've always wanted!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_4800_00_mma,Wow! You did it!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_4810_00_mma,You're one step closer to completing your dream deck!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_4900_00_mma,Where did you find it?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_5000_00_mfa,"At the card house in the grasslands, of course. The owner used his special connections to get it for me."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_5500_00_mfa,Really? Does that mean I’m your shining star?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0400_5510_00_mfa,"Oh, are you trying to flirt with me now?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_0100_00_mma,I'm so late! I got caught up watching the news.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_0200_00_mma,So Shinra is getting a new president. Hope it helps the economy.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_0400_00_mma,I really hope this doesn't lead to a war with Wutai.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_0500_00_mma,They need to catch those Avalanche guys soon.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_0600_00_mfa,Is it true that Midgar is on lockdown?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_0700_00_mfa,Better buy plenty of supplies today.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_0800_00_mfa,Avalanche? I'm more worried about the damage to my business.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_0900_00_mfa,Is something big happening in Midgar?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_2600_00_mfa,This is the very first Maghnata bookstore.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_3100_00_mfa,This is the very first store of the nationwide Maghnata Books chain.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_3200_00_mfa,It is their mission to spread knowledge of planetology...
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_3210_00_mfa,They have been tirelessly working to spread their expertise from complex skill books to the general public for generations.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_3400_00_mfa,"The original manager of this historic location has since retired, leaving it in the care of one of his pupils."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_3500_00_mfa,"And here we have the weapon shop, Selvacarsa."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_3600_00_mfa,Our blacksmiths tirelessly forge weapons to help the people of Kalm defend themselves against the monsters in the grasslands.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_3700_00_mfa,Why not browse their wares─maybe take home a souvenir?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_3710_00_mfa,The craftsmanship is second to none!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_3800_00_mfa,This is the observation tower that offers a sweeping view of the grasslands.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_3900_00_mfa,Local legend claims that a proposal made at the top is sure to be accepted...
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_3910_00_mfa,so─naturally─it's become one of the most popular date spots.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_4000_00_mfa,"Feel the vast world around you, wishing for eternal happiness."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_4100_00_mfa,Here we have the market that brings a splash of color to Kalm's dinner tables.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_4110_00_mfa,"In the morning, you can find freshly picked vegetables at the morning market."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_4200_00_mfa,"Come by in the afternoon and enjoy rustic, flavorful lunches."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_4210_00_mfa,"By evening time, it’s bustling with people shopping for their family dinners."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_4300_00_mfa,"Experience nutritious, fresh meals prepared with ingredients unique to Kalm, unlike anything from Midgar or Junon."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_4400_00_mfa,Why not try some classic hometown cooking?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_4500_00_mfa,This mako tank sustains the daily lives of Kalm's residents.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_4600_00_mfa,Mako energy is supplied from Midgar via large pipes that run above and below ground.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_4700_00_mfa,The tank is designed to resemble the water tower from Kalm's republic era.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_4710_00_mfa,It's one of Kalm's most iconic monuments.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_4900_00_mma,Got yourself a cute lover like a Chocobo?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_4910_00_mma,"Introduce me, will ya?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5000_00_mma,Not exactly like a Chocobo.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5010_00_mma,"More like a Kalm Fang, quite a looker."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5100_00_mma,"Oh, a boyfriend? I see, congrats!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5200_00_mma,"I've started making Kalm Kokeshi dolls lately, and it's paying off nicely."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5300_00_mma,"Oh, the Kokeshi dolls! My wife bought one and said it's adorable."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5400_00_mma,"Adorable, huh... They creep me out. Had nightmares about them chasing me."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5500_00_mma,Failed another interview. That makes twenty-seven times. I'm getting fed up.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5510_00_mma,What exactly am I doing wrong?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5600_00_mfa,"You'd be stable taking over the forestry business here, and you have such a lovely wife."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5700_00_mfa,Why are you so fixated on a job in Midgar?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5800_00_mma,"I want to become a honeybee, a beautiful honeybee!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5900_00_mmk,"When I grow up, I'm gonna be a SOLDIER and fight bad guys!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_5910_00_mmk,That's why I'm training hard now!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6300_00_mfa,"Fresh air, endless skies, and no plate overhead, this sense of freedom is amazing!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6400_00_mfa,This place is perfect for forgetting about breaking up with my boyfriend.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6500_00_mfa,"Yeah, that guy..."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6510_00_mfa,"I can't believe he dumped me too, seriously!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6600_00_mfa,"Wait, you were seeing him too? How come I never heard about this?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6700_00_mfa,"Oh shoot, that was supposed to be a secret."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6800_00_mma,I got lost the other day and ended up at the lookout point.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6810_00_mma,Ran into a group of bandits there. It was a nightmare!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_6900_00_mfa,You're still as directionally challenged as ever.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7000_00_mfa,"Remember when you tried to go to the farm but ended up at the docks, chased by monsters?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7100_00_mma,"Yeah, I tend to wander off when I'm sky-gazing."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7200_00_mma,"""I am Baron Kylegate! Behold this majestic wall!"""
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7300_00_mma,"""The future of Kalm is bright indeed!"""
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7400_00_mma,"No, that's not quite right."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7410_00_mma,I need to come up with better stories for the Calm Theater Company.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7500_00_mmk,Good morning! What should we do once everyone arrives?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7700_00_mfk,"Oh, right! We need to decide who's 'it' once we're all here."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7800_00_mfa,"I was really looking forward to the event in Midgar this weekend, but now it's canceled."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7810_00_mfa,I was aiming to win the materia pop eating contest and taste all the flavors.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_7900_00_mfa,"Well, there's a limited edition Titan pop coming out next week. Maybe we can wait until then?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8000_00_mfa,"That one's so big, it fills me up. I won't be able to try all the other flavors."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8100_00_mfa,"By the way, have you read the new release of 'Cactuar King' from Moogle Bookstore?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8300_00_mfa,"I'll lend it to you, but don't spoil it for anyone else, okay?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8400_00_mma,My son works in Midgar now.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8410_00_mma,"We had a falling out, but I heard he became a successful professional singer."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8600_00_mfa,I finally got my hands on the new issue of <i>Mysteryc</i>!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8610_00_mfa,Look at this!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8700_00_mfa,There are beautiful pictures of republic-era tanks and windmills!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8800_00_mma,How can you enjoy looking at a photo book of ruins?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_8900_00_mma,"<i>Chocoboy Weekly</i> has Chocobo gravure photos, you know."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_9000_00_mfa,"No, thanks."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_9010_00_mfa,"I prefer old, historical items that have a sense of history over cute things."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_9100_00_mfa,"Oh, I really want to travel to Cosmo Canyon someday..."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_10100_00_mfa,That's because there's less mako coming from Midgar.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_10110_00_mfa,"Ever since AVALANCHE blew up the mako reactor, the town's barely gotten by."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_10300_00_mfa,"Either way, it's a great chance to make your husband buy you a new one!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_10400_00_mma,"Nowadays, everything runs on mako energy."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_10410_00_mma,It's amazing how convenient everything's become.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_10600_00_mma,"I thought this place was just some rural backwater, but Kalm's actually pretty nice. I might end up moving here."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_10700_00_mma,"So, do you have anything like the Honeybee Inn here?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_10800_00_mma,"Nope, you'll have to make do with the bars."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0500_10900_00_mma,I know you've been spending all your money on those dancers and running from debt collectors.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_4500_00_mma,How much is this one here?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_4600_00_mma,"Yeah, I better pick up one of these."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_5000_00_mfa,"Mm, this one looks sharp."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_5100_00_mfa,"Extra bullets, a couple cans of oil... Gotta be prepared for anything these days."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_7700_00_mma,Chocobo Express! Delivery!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_7800_00_mma,Got a package with your name on it!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_7900_00_mma,"Yeah, looking good!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8000_00_mma,"Okay, say cheese!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8100_00_mma,That's perfect!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8200_00_mma,Beautiful. You got it!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8300_00_mfa,Ahaha.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8400_00_mfa,Hehe.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8500_00_mfa,Is this okay?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8600_00_mfa,I'm exhausted!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8700_00_mma,How about this?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8800_00_mma,Hahaha!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_8900_00_mma,Am I good or what?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9000_00_mma,Check out this pose!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9100_00_mfa,"Yeah, that's the stuff!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9200_00_mfa,How do I do it?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9300_00_mfa,Like this?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9400_00_mfa,Ah! Out of focus...
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9600_00_mfk,It's so tall! I can't wait to draw a picture of Midgar.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9800_00_mma,What's that? You want my business card?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9810_00_mma,I used to work in Shinra's Space and Aeronautics Division.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_9900_00_mma,We were busy every day developing rockets.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10000_00_mma,"We were so busy, there was barely time to nap."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10010_00_mma,But the pay was good. We made in a day what most people earn in a month.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10100_00_mma,"Jealous, huh? Want my business card now?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10400_00_mma,How's life treating you?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10410_00_mma,I handed my business over to my son. The hotel he's running in Costa del Sol seems to be doing great.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10500_00_mma,"Oh, that's wonderful news!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10510_00_mma,"As for me, I'm planning to invest in chocobo racing."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_10600_00_mma,"Hmm, if it's chocobos you're interested in, it might be cheaper to just buy an entire farm."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12200_00_mfa,Our sweets are made with local cherries and chocolate.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12210_00_mfa,"Go ahead, try a free sample!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12300_00_mfa,We also have a Midgar style selection!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12310_00_mfa,They're incredibly sweet but zero-calorie!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12400_00_mma,How about trying some mysterious chocobo-made coffee?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12500_00_mma,Enjoy a wonderful moment with our unique chocobo coffee.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12600_00_mma,Have you heard the rumors about chocoffee?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_12800_00_mma,They say it's made from saraha nuts chewed by chocobos.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13000_00_mfa,"Finally, we're in! It's really crowded today."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13100_00_mma,Even on a day like this...
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13110_00_mma,"The legend says if you confess your love at the top of this tower, you'll have a happy marriage."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13200_00_mfa,"Oh, not me though! No confessions for me."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13300_00_mma,Kalm Kokeshi! Get your Kalm Kokeshi here!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13400_00_mma,"Made from natural local wood from the Grasslands, guaranteed to bring romantic success."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13500_00_mma,"Good luck, love, and family safety! These benefits are real!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13510_00_mma,Get your Kalm Kokeshi doll! Perfect as a souvenir!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_13800_00_mfa,"I heard things are pretty rough in Midgar. Avalanche is tearing up the place, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_14100_00_mfa,Oh my! That does sound more concerning.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_14600_00_mfa,How about some chocobo-flavored ice cream?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_14700_00_mfa,Made with rich milk straight from Grasslands Farm!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_14800_00_mfa,And we've added a handful of lasan nuts too!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_14900_00_mfa,Soft and creamy moogle buns!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_15000_00_mfa,Even the pom is filled with cream!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0600_15100_00_mfa,How about sharing a moogle bun with someone special? It's a perfect treat!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0100_00_mma,There's so much fresh produce to choose from!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0200_00_mma,Hmm... What should I buy today?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0300_00_mma,"Let's see, what's the special for today?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0400_00_mma,"Alright, got the vegetables. Now for the meat and cheese."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0500_00_mma,I love the market! The scent of fresh vegetables is so invigorating!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0600_00_mfa,"Ifrit oil is on sale, I should grab some."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0700_00_mfa,"Next, let's stock up at that shop."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0800_00_mfa,What should I put in today's salad?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_0900_00_mfa,"Hmm, both of these are cheap. Gotta be careful not to overspend."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_1000_00_mfa,"Alright, let's hit the shops today!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_2100_00_mfa,Hello and welcome to my humble shop!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_2200_00_mfa,Stock up on whatever you need!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_2300_00_mfa,Go on. Take a look around!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_2400_00_mfa,Thanks. Hope to see you again soon!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_2500_00_mfa,Thank you so much!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_2600_00_mfa,You have yourself a wonderful day!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_2700_00_mma,This place has great customer service. It's my go-to.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_2800_00_mma,Heh heh heh... Don't mind me. I'm just window-shopping.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_3000_00_mfa,"Vending machines don't have that personal touch, you know?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_3100_00_mfa,Maybe I should grab some potions.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_4700_00_mfa,All my vegetables are locally sourced!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_4800_00_mfa,Don't pass up these succulent fruits straight from the orchard!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_5600_00_mma,Fresh fish from Junon harbor! Right here!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_5700_00_mma,"Good grilled, baked, or fried!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_6500_00_mma,How about a slice of Kalm's mystery pizza?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_6600_00_mma,Just one bite and you'll find yourself running back for more!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_7400_00_mfa,Household goods! We've got everything you need!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_7500_00_mfa,All the essentials at bargain prices!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_8300_00_mfa,Fresh bread─straight from the oven!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_8400_00_mfa,We've got plenty of sandwiches and lunches too!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_9200_00_mma,"Locally raised beef and pork, fresh from the grasslands!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_9300_00_mma,How about treating your family to some thick-cut steaks tonight?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_10100_00_mma,Buy meat from my store - you won't find it cheaper anywhere else!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_10300_00_mma,Every cut is recommended! Why not take them all home?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_13000_00_mma,Come on over and have a look!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_13100_00_mma,"Bargain prices, right here!"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0700_13200_00_mma,Feel free to browse and touch! Take your time!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0100_00_mma,Nothing like a leisurely stroll to clear your head.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0200_00_mma,"This tranquility is what makes Kalm, Kalm."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0300_00_mma,Ahhh... There's a nice breeze today.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0400_00_mma,"No matter what happens outside these walls, I know we'll be safe in Kalm."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0500_00_mma,I can never get enough of this view.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0600_00_mfa,I love how time almost seems to stop here.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0700_00_mfa,The scent of flowers on the wind is simply divine.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0800_00_mfa,Maybe today I'll meet the person of my dreams.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_0900_00_mfa,Moving here was the best decision of my life.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_1000_00_mfa,I pray these peaceful days last forever.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_2100_00_mma,Hmmm-hm-hmmm♪
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_3800_00_mfa,"Is it just me, or is Broden not doing too well?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4000_00_mfa,"Didn't you use to have a crush on him? Said his sad smile was charming, or something?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4400_00_mma,"So, how was your trip to Midgar? Did you stop by the Honeybee Inn like you always do?"
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4500_00_mma,"Oh man, the show was amazing! The blonde dancer's moves were sharp as ever."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4600_00_mma,Then he ended up dressing like a woman and going to Corneo's mansion.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4610_00_mma,I wonder what's happened to him now.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4619_00_mma,There's a rumor that a war might start. What should we do?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4620_00_mma,Should we cancel our Honeybee Inn tour?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4621_00_mma,No way! We need to get energized by the honeys now more than ever!
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4622_00_mma,I hope that blonde dancer is still around.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4700_00_mfa,"That's it, bloom beautifully."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_4800_00_mfa,"Ah, what a lovely scent."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5200_00_mma,Hmm... What exactly are the black-robed figures?
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5300_00_mma,I bet Shinra's dark secrets are involved somehow.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5400_00_mma,I'm an author researching those black-robed individuals.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5500_00_mma,"The common theory is that they suffer from severe mako poisoning, but there's also speculation that they're victims of special experiments."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5600_00_mma,"I feel like there's an even deeper secret, but I need to gather evidence and verify it first."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_5700_00_mma,"It'd be troublesome to make an enemy of Shinra, after all."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6000_00_mma,Those fluffy steamed buns with sweet and savory minced meat... they were delicious.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6100_00_mma,The one thing I regret about leaving Midgar is not being able to have those Sector 8 buns whenever I want.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6200_00_mma,"Oh, and that girl who sold them... my little bun vendor."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6210_00_mma,I wonder how she's doing now.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6300_00_mfa,"If we picked some flowers from the hill overlooking Midgar, it might make this flowerbed even prettier."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6500_00_mfa,"Red, blue, yellow... and some green foxtails too."
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_6600_00_mfa,I'm sure they would add a nice touch.
$KALMT_NPC_10_0800_7100_00_mfa,He wasn’t looking well... Maybe he went somewhere to recover.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0100_00_mma,A trooper smacked me. This wound? All because of Avalanche.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0200_00_mma,I heard the Mako tank in Kalm is in danger too due to the reactor bombings.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0300_00_mma,"Looks like Shinra's serious, deploying their army like that."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0310_00_mma,Those rumors about a war with Wutai might actually come true.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0500_00_mma,"Thanks to Avalanche, our lives are going to get a lot harder."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0600_00_mfa,"If the mako supply to Kalm gets cut off, we're done for."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_0900_00_mfa,It really looks like another war with Wutai is going to happen.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_1000_00_mfa,I don't even want to think about how many people died when the plate fell.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2100_00_mma,Kalm is currently under strict surveillance. Keep your outings to a minimum.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2200_00_mma,"Once you're done with your business, leave immediately!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2500_00_mma,The monster advisory level is currently at: Caution!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2510_00_mma,Recent security operations have agitated the local fiends!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_2600_00_mma,Do not approach them under any circumstances!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7200_00_mma,"Come to think of it, I saw these odd people in black robes wandering the wastelands outside Midgar."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7300_00_mma,Shoulda heard the way they were moaning. Gave me the creeps.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7400_00_mfa,Prob'ly some slum rats looking to get out of Midgar. Making a run for it with just the clothes on their backs.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_7500_00_mma,Like you guys did?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8300_00_mfa,"So, uh, what do these Avalanche people look like?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8400_00_mma,No one knows. They didn't show any pictures on the news.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8500_00_mfa,Then how're we supposed to identify them?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8600_00_mma,"Eh, just hand over anyone who looks shady."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8700_00_mfa,Oh yeah? Maybe I should start by reporting you.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8800_00_mma,"Man, that freaked me out."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_8900_00_mma,Almost ran over a bunch of guys in black cloaks on my way to Kalm.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9000_00_mfa,That was close.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9100_00_mfa,"Those guys are mako addicts, right? Maybe they got kicked out of Midgar."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9200_00_mma,They were walking in a group. It's pretty rare around here.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9800_00_mfa,Children of the planet! Hear the cries of the stars!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_9900_00_mfa,"The planet weeps, the planet mourns, the planet seethes in anger."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_10000_00_mfa,Avalanche's assault is a warning from the planet. The tornado that struck is proof of its wrath.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_10100_00_mfa,"Mako is the lifeblood of the planet. If the planet's life ends, then human life will also come to an end."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0100_10200_00_mfa,We must not deplete the Lifestream! Our lives are intertwined with the planet's life.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0100_00_mma,It's Avalanche's fault mako is running low. We'll catch them for sure!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0300_00_mma,"Whether it's Avalanche or Shinra, neither side winning benefits us."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0400_00_mma,"If the mako shortage continues, Kalm will dry up."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0500_00_mma,Avalanche in Kalm? No one told me that!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0600_00_mfa,Did the plate really fall?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0800_00_mfa,Mako's running low. We need to conserve while we can.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_0900_00_mfa,Shinra can do some really terrifying things...
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_1000_00_mfa,Anyone know what those cloaked guys in the grasslands are up to?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2100_00_mma,"With the mako gone, the power suddenly cut out."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2110_00_mma,Hurry up and get it fixed!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2200_00_mma,My fridge is broken too. It's making all sorts of noises. What are you going to do about it?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2300_00_mma,So the mako pipeline is down? When are you going to fix it?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2600_00_mfa,"Hey, what's going on? There's hardly any mako coming to our house!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2700_00_mfa,My washing machine isn't working. Can you do something about it?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_2800_00_mfa,"Send us more mako soon, will you?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3100_00_mma,"Finally, it's fixed. We can get back to normal life."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3200_00_mma,Thanks to the repairman.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3300_00_mma,"Don't let this happen again, alright?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3600_00_mfa,"So it's finally fixed. They should have done it sooner, though."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3700_00_mfa,Time to deal with all the piled-up laundry.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_3800_00_mfa,"Ah, now the mako can finally circulate."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_4100_00_mfa,"So the new president of Shinra is President's son, Rufus Shinra, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_4200_00_mfa,He still seems quite young. Can he really handle the pressures of such a big corporation?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_4400_00_mfa,"Being good-looking isn't what gets the job done, you know."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_5100_00_mma,Avalanche was in this town? How did we not notice!?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_5200_00_mma,"Next time they come, we'll take them down."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_5210_00_mma,Guarding the mako reactor is part of our inspection team duties too.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_5900_00_mma,"I've endured Shinra's interrogations and waited. Surely, something good will come my way, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6000_00_mfa,"Look over there, they're already practicing the dance for the harvest festival."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6100_00_mfa,"If I were a bit younger, I would join them too."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6200_00_mma,"'It's that time of year again, huh?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6210_00_mma,"Even if you can't do any wild dancing, you can still join in and move to the rhythm."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6300_00_mfa,"Heh, I wonder how many years it's been since I last danced."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_6310_00_mfa,The last time I danced was back when we first met at Wall Market.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7200_00_mmk,"Whop, whop, whop! Whoosh! Airships are the coolest!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7300_00_mmk,"Paratroopers, go!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7400_00_mmk,"Someday, I want to ride a real one. Let's join Shinra's troops when we grow up!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7500_00_mmk,"Yeah, we'll teach those bad guys a lesson!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7600_00_mfa,I always get nervous when Shinra's around.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7610_00_mfa,Feels like they're watching my every move.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7700_00_mma,"Yeah, seeing those soldier helmets makes me tense up even if I'm not doing anything wrong."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7800_00_mfa,But what if there was a handsome guy under that helmet?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0200_7900_00_mma,"Oh, in that case, I might just allow a little frisking!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0700_00_mfa,It's been a while since you asked me out for lunch.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0800_00_mfa,"So, how much do you need this time? Last time it was three hundred gil."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0900_00_mma,"Um, maybe around five hundred gil?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_0910_00_mma,"With that, I can get Fuzzy Wuzzy."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_1000_00_mfa,"You're really hopeless, you know that?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2200_00_mmk,Meow meow!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2400_00_mmk,"Here, have some food!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2500_00_mfk,"Hey, that's for chocobos!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2900_00_mfa,The reactors are withering the land.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_2910_00_mfa,The nature in Kalm is preserved because we don't have a reactor.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3000_00_mfa,"Oh no, not another lecture!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3100_00_mfa,You know what? Maybe I'll join Avalanche!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3200_00_mfa,Each person's actions can help protect the planet. Isn't that inspiring?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3300_00_mfa,"Come on, we already enjoy a peaceful life thanks to mako energy. Isn't that enough?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3400_00_mma,Not that one... What about this one?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0300_3500_00_mma,Hmm... They don't look like they've got much money.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_0100_00_mma,Breaking news...
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_0200_00_mma,"We've received reports that Avalanche, the anti-Shinra group wanted for the Midgar bombings, has taken refuge in Kalm."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_0300_00_mma,"In response, Shinra has dispatched a search team to Kalm."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_0400_00_mma,"The town was temporarily locked down to search for Avalanche, but the lockdown has now been lifted."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_0600_00_mma,"Avalanche is still at large, and the Public Security division continues to investigate."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_0700_00_mma,It's believed that local collaborators in Kalm aided their escape.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_0800_00_mma,"An in-depth investigation, including looking into these collaborators, will follow."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_0910_00_mma,Shinra is asking residents to provide any information they may have.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_1000_00_mma,Rewards will be offered for valuable information leading to arrests.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_2800_00_mma,"First they targeted Midgar, and now Kalm..."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_2810_00_mma,Even money says Avalanche is planning something in Junon next.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_2900_00_mma,"I wish Shinra would just hurry up and catch them, for crying out loud."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_2910_00_mma,When are we ever going to go back to the peaceful times?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_3300_00_mma,"They'd probably go to a bar where people gather, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_3400_00_mma,So does that mean Avalanche could be in this very place?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0400_3500_00_mma,"Yeah, now everyone is starting to look suspicious."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_0100_00_mma,Thought my roof was gonna blow off from those helicopters' downdraft.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_0200_00_mma,Why would Avalanche choose Kalm as their target!?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_0400_00_mma,Kalm was rebuilt just ten years ago.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_0410_00_mma,We can't handle it being destroyed again.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_0500_00_mma,The whole house shook and half our plates got broken.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_0600_00_mfa,"Hey, where did my laundry go? I just hung it up!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_0700_00_mfa,The situation must be really dire if Shinra's sending in troops.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_0800_00_mfa,"When the helicopters came, a ton of rats came scurrying out."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_0900_00_mfa,I hope everything gets back to normal soon.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_2200_00_mmk,Did you see those parachutes!? They were amazing! I want to try that someday.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_2300_00_mmk,So I need to train even harder!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_2600_00_mfa,This one's for him!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_2700_00_mfa,Hey─cut it out!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_2800_00_mfa,You're so annoying!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_2900_00_mfa,Ugh!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_3000_00_mfa,"Haha, we make a good team."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_3100_00_mfa,Haha... maybe more than a team?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_3200_00_mma,'I am Baron Kylegate!'
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_3210_00_mma,"'Curse you, Shinra! I'll make you pay for this!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_3300_00_mma,'Crawl beneath the earth like the vermin you are!'
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_3400_00_mma,Everyone loves a good revenge tale.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_3410_00_mma,"I've outdone myself. Throw what you will at me, world─I'll spin it into pure gold."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_3500_00_mmk,"Ready or not, here I come!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_4100_00_mmk,Rawr! I'm gonna get you!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_4200_00_mmk,Maybe over here?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_4300_00_mmk,"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_5900_00_mmk,Gotcha!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_6000_00_mmk,Found you!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_10400_00_mfk,Ahahaha!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_10700_00_mfk,Nyahaha!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_11300_00_mmk,"Caught you all! Okay, let's go again!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_12000_00_mfa,"Oh yeah, it's got loads!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_12010_00_mfa,The showdown between the king and the prince was intense!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_12200_00_mfa,"Of course he does, but I don't want to spoil it. Hurry up and read it already so we can talk about the ending!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_12400_00_mfa,My condolences.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0500_12600_00_mfa,"There's a bounty on them, so it's a chance to strike it rich!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_0100_00_mma,All quiet—just the way it should be.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_0200_00_mma,Maybe I'll go take a look at the mako tank.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_0300_00_mma,I hope the days of nothing happening continue.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_0500_00_mma,I have a feeling good times are ahead.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_0600_00_mfa,Maybe I should take a walk down to the farm.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_0900_00_mfa,I'd love to travel the world on a chocobo.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_1000_00_mfa,They really need to fix those roads. My backside hurts.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_2100_00_mma,"Hey, is it true we're about to go to war again?"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_2200_00_mma,Does the SRC have any connection to Avalanche?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_2300_00_mma,"Whatever happens, I hope Kalm doesn't get dragged into it."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_2500_00_mma,What is this 'Resistance Committee' anyway?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_2600_00_mfa,The 'Resistance Committee'? Won't it be crushed in no time?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_2900_00_mfa,"War? He won't have to go, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_3000_00_mfa,Should we start stocking up on emergency food supplies?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_4100_00_mma,Welcome to Kalm. There are a lot of unsettling incidents happening outside.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_4200_00_mma,"If anything happens, report it to the Vigilante Committee immediately."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_4400_00_mma,Monster advisory in effect. Stay alert!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_4410_00_mma,"If you spot a pack of them, don't get close."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_5200_00_mma,"Let's go, little brother. Time for an Elphadunk-style charge!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_5300_00_mma,"Alright, bring it on!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_5300_01_mma,Oof!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_5400_00_mma,Yes! Behold the power of the Singles Club. Nothing can stop us!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_5500_00_mma,"Yeah, you're the best, bro!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_5600_00_mma,"Alright, one more time! I'm gonna charge at you with the burning passion of a thousand suns!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_5700_01_mma,Ow!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_5700_00_mma,Lemme have it!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_5800_00_mma,Did you see that? That's how we express our feelings in Kalm!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_5900_00_mma,Yeah! You're on fire!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_6000_00_mma,"We of the Singles Club sadly remain as single as ever... But don't give in to despair, my dear brother! We're not throwing in the towel yet!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_6100_01_mma,Ungh!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_6100_00_mma,Brother!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_6200_00_mma,"With this charge, we'll protect Kalm!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_6300_00_mma,"Yeah, we can definitely protect Kalm!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_6700_00_mfa,Have you seen any of those guys in black cloaks since then?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_6800_00_mma,"No, they haven't been around here for a while."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_6900_00_mfa,Do you think they've gone somewhere far away?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_7000_00_mma,Where would they go? I doubt they have anyplace to be.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0100_7100_00_mfa,"Who knows, maybe they have some hidden lair."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_0100_00_mma,Playing hooky for a quick drink.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_0300_00_mma,Make sure to check out the famous mako tank here in Kalm.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_0400_00_mma,"If you're having a drink, I recommend the Rusty Arrow."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_0500_00_mma,"If you're tired, you can rest at the Kalm Inn."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_0600_00_mfa,"The area around the mako tank is a convenient meeting spot, isn't it?"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_0800_00_mfa,What’s the monster advisory level for today?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_0900_00_mfa,I hope Rufus Shinra does well.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_1000_00_mfa,"Oh, traveling to various places sounds like so much fun!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_1100_00_mma,"If a war starts, we'll face a mako shortage, won't we?"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_1300_00_mma,Does the Anti-Shinra Committee have members here in Kalm too?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_1400_00_mma,There's nothing a pint of Kalm's finest can't fix.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_1500_00_mma,I heard Broden from the inn has gone missing.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_1600_00_mfa,"That broadcast sounded like a challenge to Shinra, didn't it?"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_1800_00_mfa,Now's the time to lift our spirits with a dance!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_1900_00_mfa,I'm sure President Rufus will put an end to this war.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_2000_00_mfa,I'll drink some Kalm wine and try to forget everything.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_3200_00_mfa,It's tough right after becoming president.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_3210_00_mfa,"Avalanche really went all out, huh? But who knows, maybe the real culprit is Wutai."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_3400_00_mfa,"Really, that's what you're worried about?"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_3600_00_mfa,Everyone's saying there could be a war. What do you think?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_4200_00_mma,Mako Reactor Inspection Squad!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_4210_00_mma,Let's build up our strength so we're always ready for an inspection!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_4300_00_mma,One...! Two...! One...! Two...! Everything the Mako Reactor Inspection Squad does is for the reactors!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_4400_00_mma,"Let's keep it up, team!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_4500_00_mma,"Ugh, she dumped me!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_4600_00_mma,Why? Was it too soon to propose without even dating first?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_4700_00_mma,But the Love Horoscope Weekly said to confess passionately and without hesitation!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_4800_00_mfa,They're saying there might be another war. What should we do?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_4900_00_mma,"Don't worry, Shinra always wins."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_5000_00_mma,"They've beaten both the Republic of Junon and Wutai, after all."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0200_5100_00_mfa,"Oh my, how reassuring. Shinra is as bold as you once were."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_0100_00_mma,We interrupt our regular programming with breaking news.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_0200_00_mma,"During a ceremony held in Junon by the Shinra Company,"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_0210_00_mma,"our new president, Rufus Shinra, was attacked."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_0300_00_mma,"Fortunately, President Rufus was unharmed and is able to continue his duties."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_0400_00_mma,"According to Public Security, eyewitnesses reported seeing a suspicious woman, believed to be of Wutaian descent, near the event site at the time of the incident."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_0500_00_mma,Authorities are currently investigating her possible involvement.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_0600_00_mma,They are also looking into potential connections with Avalanche.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_0700_00_mma,This follows a recent hijacking of a broadcast by the Shinra Resistance Committee and the interim Wutaian government.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_0800_00_mma,"In response to growing unrest among the populace, the Shinra Electric Power Company"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_0900_00_mma,has announced that President Rufus will make a public statement in the near future to address these concerns.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_1000_00_mma,Public Security advises staying calm and not getting caught up in the confusion.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_1010_00_mma,They encourage everyone to carry on with their daily routines.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_3200_00_mma,"Well, that makes sense."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_3300_00_mma,But what if Wutai is involved?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_3400_00_mma,"In that case, I'll bet they're in on it together."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_3600_00_mma,So maybe all those attacks by AVALANCHE were just setting the stage?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_3700_00_mma,"Seriously, why can't people live peacefully?"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_3710_00_mma,Is there really anything that bad about how Shinra's running things?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_3800_00_mma,Hmm... I'm poor?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_4000_00_mma,Right there with you!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_5100_00_mfa,At an official Shinra press conference held earlier today...
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_5200_00_mfa,a spokesperson confirmed that the inauguration in Junon will be held tomorrow as scheduled.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_5300_00_mfa,What exciting festivities does our new company president have in store for the city?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_5400_00_mfa,Make sure to tune in tomorrow to find out.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_5500_00_mfa,"We have received new information regarding Avalanche, the anti-Shinra group responsible for multiple terrorist attacks in Midgar."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_5600_00_mfa,"According to a recent statement from Public Security, key members remain at large..."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_5700_00_mfa,and those who concealed them in Kalm have yet to be apprehended.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_5800_00_mfa,Shinra is asking citizens to come forward if they have information concerning Avalanche's current whereabouts...
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_5900_00_mfa,or the identities of their associates.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_6100_00_mfa,"Today, the Shinra Electric Power Company is celebrating the inauguration of Rufus Shinra."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_6200_00_mfa,Many people have come to the fortified city of Junon to witness the new president's grand debut.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_6300_00_mfa,"At the ceremony, President Rufus will deliver his inauguration speech outlining the future of the Shinra Company."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0400_6400_00_mfa,There is hope that President Rufus will bring a breath of fresh air to the Shinra Company amid its current challenges.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_0100_00_mma,"Well, it's been a while. Time to get back to work!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_0200_00_mma,I wonder what I'll make for dinner tonight.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_0400_00_mma,It's my turn to cook today. Guess I'd better head to the market.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_0500_00_mma,"Yeah, there's nothing better than a peaceful day."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_0600_00_mfa,The sound of the Calm clock chimes always lifts my spirits.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_0700_00_mfa,Such a nice day. Perfect for doing laundry.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_0800_00_mfa,I decided to keep some of those rats as pets!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_0900_00_mfa,"Oh, hello there."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_2100_00_mma,What do you think of the anti-Shinra organization?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_2200_00_mma,"Are the anti-Shinra people really bad guys, or what?"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_2400_00_mma,It might be wise to stock up on food before things get dangerous.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_2500_00_mma,"No matter what happens, work comes first!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_2600_00_mfa,Do you really think it’s going to turn into a war?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_2700_00_mfa,I wish my worries would just fly away like my laundry.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_2800_00_mfa,I hope everything settles down by the time the harvest festival comes around.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_2900_00_mfa,Everyone’s been uneasy since that Wutai broadcast.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_4100_00_mfa,"Hey, let’s go on a date on our next day off."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_4200_00_mfa,How about we go to the Gold Saucer?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_4300_00_mfa,I hear they have fun couples events there!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_4310_00_mfa,Sounds like a blast!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_4400_00_mma,I will construct a wall to protect this town for all eternity.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_4500_00_mma,Now come and shower me with praise for my magnificent accomplishments! For I am none other than Mütten Kylegate!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_4600_00_mma,Ha! I'm astounded by my own talent. This script truly is magical.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_4610_00_mma,I'm certain it will move any audience member.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_4700_00_mma,I will construct a wall to protect this town for all eternity.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_4800_00_mma,Now come and shower me with praise for my magnificent accomplishments! For I am none other than Mütten Kylegate!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_4900_00_mma,"Oh, hello everyone! Have you come to see our latest production?"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_4910_00_mma,It's free for a limited time!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_5000_00_mma,"Even so, we can't seem to fill the seats."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_5100_00_mma,Why is that? Is everyone too anxious about the impending war?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_5200_00_mma,Now is the time for a magical script to bring dreams to life!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_5400_00_mfa,Right? Which part did you like the most?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_5600_00_mfa,What's going to happen to the hidden treasure in the Corel Desert?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_5610_00_mfa,"Oh, I can't wait to see what happens next!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_5700_00_mma,I found a poster and a music disc of my son's.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_5710_00_mma,"My son, Akira, is a popular singer."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_5800_00_mma,He's really making a name for himself in Wall Market.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_5900_00_mma,"Someday, he might come back to Kalm on tour."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_5910_00_mma,"Until that grand homecoming, I'll keep spreading the word here."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_6000_00_mma,"Kalm's very own superstar, Akira! Don't miss his homecoming concert!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_6100_00_mma,"Come one, come all! It's Akira's soul-stirring concert!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_6200_00_mma,I heard there's a popular singer from Midgar here.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_6300_00_mma,This voice... It really touches my heart.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_6400_00_mma,"That outfit is so dazzling, it's almost blinding."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_6500_00_mma,I heard he's conquered Midgar and is now expanding to the region.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_6600_00_mma,Do you think he'd perform at our harvest festival?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_6700_00_mfa,Ahhh! Akira!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_6800_00_mfa,Look over here!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_6900_00_mfa,"I'm so excited, I might faint!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_7000_00_mfa,This is the perfect way to lift my spirits.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_7100_00_mfa,"I adore you, Akira!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_7300_00_mfa,Well done!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0500_7500_00_mfa,I see. Maybe I should get one too?
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_0100_00_mma,"Ah, the perfect breeze!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_0200_00_mma,Doesn't matter what's going on out there—it won't affect us.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_0300_00_mma,Maybe we'll take our next trip to Costa del Sol.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_0400_00_mma,There's nothing like a vacation to bring the family together.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_0600_00_mfa,Climbing the clock tower always helps clear my head.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_0800_00_mfa,A moogle bun sounds so good right about now.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_0900_00_mfa,"Now, what kind of coffee should I try next?"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_1000_00_mfa,You gotta be at the top when it chimes. Trust me.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_2100_00_mma,I hope this perfect view doesn't get destroyed.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_2200_00_mma,I can't believe those Wutaians want to go to war again.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_2300_00_mma,The whole point of moving to quiet Kalm was for some peace and quiet...
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_2400_00_mma,"If there's a war, even Kalm won't remain untouched."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_2600_00_mfa,Just the thought of another war makes me sick.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_2800_00_mfa,The anti-Shinra faction doesn't stand a chance. They'll be crushed in no time.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_2900_00_mfa,"No matter what happens, Kalm will be safe, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0600_3000_00_mfa,"No war until after my Costa del Sol vacation, got it?!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_0100_00_akr,"Hey, Kalm! How y'all doin' out here?!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_0200_00_akr,"Still reppin' Shinra Records,<br>it's your boy Akira back in town!"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_0300_00_akr,Seven grueling years away from my hometown of Kalm...<br>there were times I thought we'd never make it.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_0400_00_akr,"But I kept looking up at the Midgar sky,<br>searching for a star I couldn't see."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_0500_00_akr,"I always dreamed I'd come back a star,<br>once I made it big."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_0600_00_akr,"Haha... well, I kinda left Midgar before achieving that."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_0700_00_akr,"But with this voice of mine, I can still lift your spirits, right?"
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_0800_00_akr,"So, everyone, please listen to my song,<br>'On the Road, Chasing Dreams'."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_0900_00_akr,Thank you!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_1000_00_akr,This next one's got a bit of a bittersweet edge to it.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_1100_00_akr,I had someone who supported me when I wasn't selling anything.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_1110_00_akr,We're not together anymore though.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_1200_00_akr,"But I still believe that my songs reach her, wherever she is now."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_1300_00_akr,Please listen to 'Golden Sparks'.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_1400_00_akr,Thank you!
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_1500_00_akr,"Lastly, please listen to my debut song."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_1600_00_akr,It's a rock 'n' roll song about getting dumped over and over again: 'Midgar Blues'.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_1700_00_akr,Thank you! I want to keep dreaming forever.
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_1800_00_akr,"So once again, please listen to my song."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_1900_00_akr,"'In the Midst of Travel, In the Midst of Dreams'."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_2000_00_akr,"Hey there! I'm Akira, a singer from Shinra Records."
$KALMT_NPC_30_0700_2100_00_akr,Here's one of my favorites: 'Journey in a Dream.'
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_0100_00_lud,"Elena, execute Pattern A."
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_0200_00_eln,Got it! Um... which one was that?
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_0300_00_lud,"Elena, switch to Pattern B!"
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_0400_00_eln,"Uh, alright! I'm on it!"
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_0500_00_lud,"Elena, Pattern C now."
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_0600_00_eln,Got it! I think I'm good!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_0700_00_eln,"Hey, Rude? Let's stick with Pattern A."
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_0800_00_lud,Understood...
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_0900_00_eln,"Rude! Was it Pattern B? Or was it C? Ugh, let's just go!"
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_1000_00_lud,You need to remember the patterns!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_1100_00_eln,"Alright, Rude! Let's go with Pattern C! Or maybe Alpha?"
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_1200_00_lud,Which one!?
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_1300_00_lud,"Get ready, newbie!"
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_1400_00_eln,It's Elena!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_1500_00_lud,We're going in hard.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_1600_00_lud,"Let's move out, Elena."
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_1700_00_eln,"Got my back, Rude!?"
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_1800_00_eln,Come on! Let's give 'em hell!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_1900_00_lud,"Elena, keep up."
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_2000_00_eln,I'll do my best!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_2100_00_eln,We need to settle Reno's score...
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_2200_00_lud,We're here to even the odds!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_2300_00_lud,Time to go all out...
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_2400_00_eln,and show them the full power of the Turks!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_2500_00_eln,"Come on, hurry!"
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_2600_00_lud,Take it easy.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_2700_00_cld,"Sorry, but I’m not losing."
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_2800_00_cld,There’s got to be a way through.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_2900_00_tif,We have to stop their attacks!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_3000_00_tif,We need to turn the tide...
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_3100_00_art,Violence is not the answer!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_3200_00_art,We have to stop them!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_3300_00_cld,Move aside.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_3400_00_cld,Out of my way.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_3500_00_cld,I'm cutting through.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_3600_00_tif,I won't let you interfere!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_3700_00_tif,I won't lose!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_3800_00_tif,You won't get away with this!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_3900_00_art,I won't let you!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_4000_00_art,"Please, step aside!"
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_4100_00_art,"Stay back, okay?"
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_4200_00_lud,Impressive.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_4300_00_lud,I'll remember this.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_4400_00_lud,Hmph...
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_4500_00_eln,What do you think you're doing?!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_4600_00_eln,This is infuriating!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_4700_00_eln,Hey!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_4710_00_art,Huh?
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_4720_00_lud,"Sorry, but I can't hold back."
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_4730_00_lud,"Wish I didn't have to, but I can't go easy on you."
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_4800_00_cld,Let's take her out first.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_4900_00_tif,She's in the way.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_5000_00_art,Is Rude being protected?
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_5100_00_eln,"Give it to them, Rude!"
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_5200_00_eln,"We’re counting on you, Rude!"
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_5300_00_lud,Leave it to me.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_5400_00_lud,Rude.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_5500_00_lud,I'll show you.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_5600_00_lud,Rude.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_5700_00_lud,Nothing personal.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_5800_00_lud,"Still in the fight, huh?"
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_5900_00_eln,"Looking good, Rude!"
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_6000_00_eln,That's how it's done!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_6100_00_eln,Nice work!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_6200_00_lud,Elena! I'll cover you!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_6300_00_lud,Finish 'em.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_6400_00_lud,You're up.
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_6500_00_eln,Copy that!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_6600_00_eln,Got it!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_6700_00_eln,I'm on it!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_7100_00_eln,The name's!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_7101_00_eln,Elena!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_7102_00_eln,Bitch!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_7200_00_eln,Don't!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_7201_00_eln,Mess with!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_7202_00_eln,The Turks!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_7300_00_eln,Rude!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_7400_00_eln,They'll pay!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_7500_00_eln,I've got you!
$MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_7600_00_lud,You good?
MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_7700_00_lud,Hold on.
MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_7800_00_lud,I got you.
MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_7900_00_eln,Sorry...Rude...
MYTHM_BOS_02_1100_8000_00_eln,"Please make the call, senpai!"
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_0100_00_blt,Ha! Found its weak spot!
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_0200_00_red,That's its weak point. Aim there!
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_0300_00_blt,"Damn, this thing's tough! Can't we find a way to beat it?"
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_0400_00_red,This isn't working. We need to find a way through.
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_0500_00_blt,Now's our chance! Don't let it slip away!
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_0600_00_red,It looks different. Let's attack now!
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_0700_00_blt,It's back to normal? Hit that weak spot again!
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_0800_00_red,I see the pattern. Aim for the weak spot again!
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_0900_00_blt,"Whoa, what's it planning now?"
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_1000_00_red,It's building up strength. Prepare for an attack!
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_1100_00_blt,"Damn, this sucker keeps on gettin' bigger and bigger... But hey─just means it's that much easier to hit 'em, am I right!?"
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_1200_00_red,This ought to be fun.
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_1300_00_blt,Huh!? It just shook it off!
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_1400_00_red,Clever...
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_1500_00_blt,Hell yeah! Try walkin' that off!
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_1600_00_blt,Gonna reduce your ass to rubble!
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_1700_00_red,Good. We're making progress.
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_1800_00_red,Let's keep chipping away...
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_1900_00_blt,"Oh, perfect. It's puttin' itself back together."
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_2000_00_red,It can regenerate? Impressive.
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_2100_00_blt,"We gotta bust this thing up quick, or we're in serious trouble!"
$MYTHM_BOS_03_1100_2200_00_red,"We must act first, or we’ll be in danger."

$C1920_MAIN_0800_0100_00_red,I take it our equipment is in order?
$C1920_MAIN_0800_0200_00_cld,What are you doing here anyway?
$C1920_MAIN_0800_0300_00_red,Standing watch. You never know when Shinra might show up.
$C1920_MAIN_0800_0310_00_sys,You never know when Shinra might show up.
$C1920_MAIN_0800_0320_00_sys,I knew I could count on you.
$C1920_MAIN_0800_0330_00_sys,Thanks.
$C1920_MAIN_0800_0340_00_sys,Good boy.
$C1920_MAIN_0800_0400_00_cld,I knew I could count on you.
$C1920_MAIN_0800_0500_00_red,Hmph. Flattery will get you nowhere.
$C1920_MAIN_0800_0600_00_cld,Thanks.
$C1920_MAIN_0800_0700_00_red,No need to worry. I'm doing this for my own sake.
$C1920_MAIN_0800_0800_00_cld,You’re pretty serious.
$C1920_MAIN_0800_0900_00_red,No one else is stepping up.<br>I’m doing it out of necessity.
$C2110_MAIN_0200_0100_00_blt,This place used to be an active mythril mine. Do you all know what mythril is?
$C2110_MAIN_0200_0200_00_tif,"Hmm... I've heard of it, but I'm not too familiar."
$C2110_MAIN_0200_0300_00_cld,It's incredibly tough.
$C2110_MAIN_0200_0400_00_red,And also quite beautiful.
$C2110_MAIN_0200_0500_00_blt,"You two are right. Plus, it's unbelievably rare."
$C2110_MAIN_0200_0600_00_blt,I've never heard of it being found outside of this place.
$C2110_MAIN_0200_0700_00_blt,"I used to work in the mines, so I know a bit about this industry."
$C2110_MAIN_0200_0800_00_art,Should we try to find some mythril?
$C2110_MAIN_0200_0900_00_blt,I wouldn't recommend it.
$C2110_MAIN_0200_1000_00_blt,Shinra's technology has made synthetic alternatives that are just as good.
$C2110_MAIN_0200_1100_00_blt,"It's incredibly hard and sparkly, you know."
$C2110_MAIN_0200_1200_00_cld,It's probably an application of materia refinement.
$C2110_MAIN_0200_1300_00_art,"Oh, really? That's interesting."
$CHADL_QST_01_1200_0100_00_chd,Looks like they're giving you quite a bit of trouble.
$CHADL_QST_01_1200_0200_00_cld,I'm letting them get away on purpose.
$CHADL_QST_01_1200_0300_00_cld,We'll follow them to their hideout and take them down. That was the plan from the start.
$CHADL_QST_01_1200_0400_00_chd,"I see, as expected of you."
$CHADL_QST_01_1200_0500_00_chd,"Before you continue the chase, try to find the key they buried."
$CHADL_QST_01_1200_0600_00_chd,A chocobo's keen sense of smell should help you locate it.
$GRASE_QST_04_0510_0100_00_cld,Should we let a chocobo sniff it out?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_2100_00_mfk,"Look, I drew Midgar! See?"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_2700_00_mfa,"Wow, I didn't expect Shinra's army to show up here!"
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_2800_00_mfa,"Since you never know what's going to happen in life, confessing here might not be so bad."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_2900_00_mma,Really?
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_3000_00_mfa,"Wait, hold on. That confession isn't meant for you, so don't jump to conclusions."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_3100_00_mma,"Look over there! Once we get past those mountains, we'll be in Junon."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_3110_00_mma,"From Junon, we can take a ship to Costa del Sol."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_3200_00_mfa,That sounds wonderful! I feel like I can already hear the ocean waves from here.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_3300_00_mma,"Yeah, but the thing is, I'm not entirely sure if we're heading the right way."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_3400_00_mfa,No problem. Let's figure it out together!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_3700_00_mfa,"From here, Midgar looks perfectly fine, but there's a lot going on beneath the surface."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_3800_00_mma,"Yeah, I guess so..."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_3900_00_mfa,Just because we're in Kalm doesn't mean we should ignore it.
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_3910_00_mfa,We need to do what we can for Midgar!
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_4000_00_mma,"Yeah, but you know, there's something even more important."
$KALMT_NPC_20_0600_4010_00_mma,How about we hold hands and think about us instead?
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_0100_00_blt,Keep aiming for its head!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_0200_00_tif,"Now's our chance, hit its head!"
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_0300_00_art,Is it easier to hit now?
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_0400_00_red,Target its head!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_0500_00_cld,It's targeting us too. Stay sharp!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_0600_00_blt,What the? It's freezing all of a sudden!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_0700_00_tif,What the...? Is it collecting heat?
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_0800_00_art,Brr... What's happening!?
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_0900_00_red,It's setting something up. Be cautious.
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_1000_00_cld,I have a bad feeling... Don't get too close!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_1100_00_cld,It's storing up the heat.
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_1200_00_blt,Is that snake turning red?
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_1300_00_tif,Is it gathering more heat?
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_1400_00_art,Did its color change?
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_1500_00_red,It seems to be heating up.
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_1600_00_cld,It's aiming for us. Stay alert.
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_1700_00_cld,Here it comes. Dodge!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_1800_00_tif,Watch your step!

$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_2300_00_blt,Damn it! I'm on my way!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_2400_00_tif,I'll save you right away!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_2500_00_tif,"Wait for me, I'm coming!"
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_2600_00_art,Leave it to me!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_2700_00_art,"No, no way!"
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_2800_00_red,I'll help you.
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_2900_00_red,Don't give up.
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_3000_00_cld,What a pain...
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_3100_00_blt,This snake's gonna burn down the whole damn swamp!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_3200_00_tif,It's gonna cook us alive!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_3300_00_art,That's not good at all!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_3400_00_red,He clearly means business.
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_3500_00_cld,Then let's end this asshole!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_3600_00_cld,Get outta the water! Hurry!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_3700_00_blt,C'mon! Move your asses!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_3800_00_tif,Get to the shore! Now!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_3900_00_art,We can't stay in the water!
$SWAMP_BOS_01_1100_4000_00_red,We need to get to dry land!
$C2110_MAIN_1600_0100_00_cld,Wait.
$C2110_MAIN_1600_0200_00_eln,"Seriously, what are we even doing here?"
$C2110_MAIN_1600_0400_00_eln,"Sorry, but I gotta say it."
$C2110_MAIN_1600_0410_00_eln,This mission? It makes no sense.
$C2110_MAIN_1600_0500_00_eln,Why are we wasting our time following these hooded weirdos around?
$C2110_MAIN_1600_0600_00_lud,Orders are orders.
$C2110_MAIN_1600_0610_00_lud,The whys and wherefores are not our concern.
$C2110_MAIN_1600_0700_00_eln,Yeesh... Maybe you need a vacation.
$C2110_MAIN_1600_0710_00_eln,"So about him, Mr. Workaholic? Thoughts?"
$C2110_MAIN_1600_0900_00_eln,I say we put him down.
$C2110_MAIN_1600_0910_00_eln,"I mean, Tseng would definitely do that."
$C2110_MAIN_1600_1000_00_tif,This is terrible...
$C2110_MAIN_1600_1100_00_eln,Who's there!?
$C2110_MAIN_1600_1200_00_cld,Got good hearing.
$C2110_MAIN_1600_1300_00_tif,Sorry.
$C2110_MAIN_1600_1400_00_eln,N-no way!
$C2110_MAIN_1600_1500_00_lud,Avalanche...
$C2110_MAIN_1600_1600_00_eln,"I'm Elena, the new and highly anticipated member of the Turks."
$C2110_MAIN_1600_1610_00_eln,"But to you lot, I'll be your worst nightmare!"
$C2110_MAIN_1600_1700_00_art,Where's Reno?
$C2110_MAIN_1600_1800_00_lud,On vacation.
$C2110_MAIN_1600_1900_00_eln,I’ll be covering for Reno while he's away!
$C2110_MAIN_1600_2000_00_lud,"She may still be a rookie, but she's a Turk."
$C2110_MAIN_1600_2010_00_lud,So don’t underestimate her.
